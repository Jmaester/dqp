<p><b>Introduction </b>

<p> We understand and respect that you are concerned about your
  privacy.  That's why we want you to know that if you choose to
  enable the Google Toolbar's advanced features (e.g., viewing the
  PageRank of web pages), the URLs of the sites you visit will
  automatically be forwarded to Google.  The purpose of our Toolbar
  Privacy Policy is to inform you of this process, explain the type of
  information Google is collecting, and explain how you can enable or
  disable the advanced functionality.


<br>
<p> <b>Overview </b> 
<ul>
  <li>Google is committed to helping its users ensure their privacy.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Google may collect information about web pages that you are viewing when 
    the advanced functionality is enabled. However, this advanced functionality 
    is optional, and can be easily disabled and re-enabled at any time (by selecting 
    "Privacy Information..." in the Toolbar's "Google" menu.)<br>
    <br>
  <li>You will know the advanced functionality is enabled when the PageRank meter 
    is visible on your Google Toolbar.<br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Google only collects the normal type of information that is already available 
    to the websites you visit. This means, Google cannot collect, for example, 
    your name, email address, telephone number, etc.<br>
    <br>
  
  <li>Google will not sell or provide personally identifiable information to any 
    third parties.<br>
    <br>
  <li>Google will notify you if it changes these policies and will give you the 
    opportunity to discontinue using the Google Toolbar. </li>
</ul>
<br>

<p><b>More Information </b>
<p>Periodically, the Google Toolbar contacts our servers to see if you are running the most current version.  
  If necessary, we will automatically provide you with the latest update to the Google Toolbar. 

<p>Some features available on the Google Toolbar can enhance your search and browsing 
  experience, but may require that we have some understanding of the web pages 
  that you are viewing. For example, by knowing which web page you are viewing, 
  the PageRank feature of Google Toolbar can show you Google's ranking of that 
  web page. Google can also use this information about the pages you have viewed 
  to improve functionality or quality, or add new features. 

<p> We believe these features will greatly enhance your browsing experience. We 
  understand, however, you may not agree that the benefits provided by these features 
  outweigh the information we must collect. For this reason, we provide you the 
  opportunity to disable these features on the Privacy Information page (accessed 
  by selecting "Privacy Information..." in the Toolbar's "Google" menu).
  With the advanced features disabled, no information about the page you are viewing 
  will be sent to Google unless you explicitly request more information about 
  that page (such as with the "Cached Snapshot", "Backward Links" or "Similar 
  Pages" features). 
  
<p> We hope you find the Toolbar Privacy Policy useful in understanding why certain 
  information is used to improve your search and browsing experience. If you have 
  any questions or comments about the Google Toolbar and your privacy, please 
  contact us at <a href="mailto:toolbar-feedback@google.com">toolbar-feedback@google.com</a>.
