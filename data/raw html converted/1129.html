<p>In effect, this is like seeing a library card catalog online. If you'd like to promote your book through Google, you are welcome to <a href="https://books.google.com/partner/signon-g">open a Partner Program account</a> and complete the easy submission process.</p>

<p>As with all of our decisions related to Google Books content, we're conservative in our reading of both copyright law and the known facts surrounding a particular book.

<p>Please note that at this time, we are not able to accept books which are out of copyright. We are hoping to include books like these in Google Books through the process of scanning at our partner libraries.</p>
<p>If you think your application would comply with our policies, we encourage you to apply. The online review process is quick and easy, and you will not be obligated in any way. When you're ready to get started with Google Books, please visit <a href="http://books.google.com/partner">http://books.google.com/partner</a>.</p>
