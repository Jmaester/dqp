    <h2>Safe Browsing Privacy Policies</h2>
    <h3>Google Safe Browsing for Firefox 3.0, Google Chrome, and Apple Safari</h3>
    <p>The <a href="privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a> describes how we treat information received when you use Google services, including the Google Safe Browsing Service as incorporated into Mozilla Firefox Version 3 and later, Apple Safari version 3.2 and later, and Google Chrome. In addition, the following specific privacy policy applies. <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/firefox3_privacy_faq.html">Answers to frequently asked questions about this privacy policy.</a>
    <h4>Personal information</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>As a Safe Browsing user, your browser will contact Google’s servers when you visit a potentially risky site. It will also periodically contact Google’s servers to download the most recent list of known phishing and malware sites. Google does not collect any account information or other personally identifying information as part of this contact, but does receive standard log information including an IP address and one or more cookies.
      <li>When you visit a site that we think could be a phishing or malware site, your browser will send Google a hashed, partial copy of the site’s URL so that we can send more information to your browser. Google cannot determine the real URL from this information. <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/firefox3_privacy_faq.html">More information about how this works.</a>
    </ul>
    <h4>Uses</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We use information about Safe Browsing usage to improve the quality of the Safe Browsing service and other Google services.
    </ul>
    <h4>Information sharing and onward transfer</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We may share aggregate statistics about Safe Browsing usage with our business partners. We will not share personally identifying information with these partners or any third parties, except under the narrow circumstances described in the <a href="privacypolicy.html">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
    </ul>
    <h4>Data retention periods</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>We maintain logs of Safe Browsing usage for a period of two weeks. This allows us to improve the quality of the service, and guard against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. After a period of two weeks, the original logs are discarded and only aggregate usage information is retained.
    </ul>
    <h3>Google Safe Browsing for Firefox 2.0</h3>
    <p>Firefox 2.0 included Google Safe Browsing built-in, and by default came with this feature enabled. Google Safe Browsing for Firefox 2.0 was disabled in Firefox 2.0.0.19, and the service was discontinued on January 20, 2009. The <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-en.html" rel="nofollow">Firefox Privacy Policy</a> covers this feature. The relevant section is included below.
    <blockquote>
      <p><em>Protection Against Suspected Forgery Sites.</em> The Firefox web forgery protection feature displays a warning if the website you are visiting is suspected of impersonating a legitimate website. Firefox lets you select various levels of protection, and different information is transmitted by Firefox depending on the level you choose.
      <p>By default, Firefox checks the web pages that you visit against a list of suspected web forgeries (a “blacklist”) that is downloaded to your hard drive at regularly scheduled intervals (e.g., approximately twice per hour), the rate of frequency may change from time to time. If there is a match, Firefox displays a “Suspected Web Forgery” alert. Each time Firefox checks in with the third party provider to download a new blacklist, Non-Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information, such as the information that the browser sends every time you visit a website as well as the version number of the blacklist on your system, is sent to the third party provider. In order to safeguard your privacy, Firefox will not transmit the URL of web pages that you visit in this default mode to anyone.
      <p>Alternately, you can check the web pages you visit against an online list that is provided by a third party service. When you select this option, Firefox sends the URL of the web page, in addition to your IP address and other Non-Personal Information, to the selected third party service provider. Firefox displays a “Suspected Web Forgery” alert if the third party service provider returns with a response indicating that the URL you are accessing is a suspected web forgery. This feature will no longer be available 180 days after the release of Firefox 3.0.
      <p>You may completely turn off the web forgery protection feature in Firefox’s preferences. If you do this, none of the information discussed here will be downloaded to your hard drive or sent to any third party service provider. For information about changing your preferences, go to our <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/options" rel="nofollow">help page</a>.
      <p>Each time Firefox checks in with the third party provider to download a new blacklist, Non-Personal Information and Potentially Personal Information, such as the information that the browser sends every time you visit a website as well as the version number of the blacklist on your system, is sent to the third party provider. In order to safeguard your privacy, Firefox will not transmit the complete URL of web pages that you visit to anyone. While it is possible that a third party service provider may determine the actual URL from the hashed URL sent, Mozilla’s third party service providers have entered into a written agreement with Mozilla not to use any data or other information about or from users of Firefox for purposes other than to provide and maintain their service. In addition, in no event will these third party service providers correlate any Firefox user data with any other data collected through other products, services or web properties of that provider. These third party service providers may inform you about additional notices regarding their applicable privacy policies.
