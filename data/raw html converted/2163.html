<p><font size="-1"><b>About Wisdom Publications
      </b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Wisdom Publications is dedicated to making available authentic Buddhist works for the
        benefit of all. With only a tiny percentage of Buddhist texts available in English, Wisdom
        takes an ecumenical approach to publishing, bringing original works from the Tibetan,
        Chinese and Zen traditions to readers in the West. In addition to producing translations,
        Wisdom publishes the work of modern teachers. Wisdom operates as a nonprofit
        charitable organization, with all profits reinvested into the creation of new works.
        Formally founded in London in 1983, the organization is currently located in Somerville,
      Massachusetts. Wisdom has 240 titles in print and publishes 24-28 new titles per year.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> <b>Challenge</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Wisdom Publications is a mission-driven publisher that pursues digitization initiatives so
its books can be discovered by more readers and green initiatives to reduce the impact
of its printing operations on the environment.

<p><font size="-1">&quot;Our mission is to make Buddhist works available to people all around the world,&quot;
        says Tim McNeill, Publisher and CEO of Wisdom Publications. &quot;We've also made a
        commitment to environmental mindfulness. For instance, whenever possible, we're
        using a paper called Glatfelter Natures Book that's made from 50% post-consumer
        recycled material. So we're interested in digitization from an environmental as well as a
        marketing perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
        To reach more readers worldwide, Wisdom is exploring ways to build its brand and
        increase its profile on a global scale. &quot;We have a strong identity – if it's published by
        Wisdom, you know it's authentic,&quot; explains Wisdom project manager Hal Hallstein, who
        spearheads initiatives to increase direct sales and develop Wisdom's web presence. &quot;The
        challenge is to take it to the next level. We're already an international publisher – some
        of our titles have been translated into as many as 20 different languages, and 20-25%
        of our sales are international – but we'd like to expand our global reach.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Solution</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><span style="background-color: #ffffff"><img alt="" width="1" height="1" /></span>Wisdom heard about Google Books through media reports when it was introduced
in 2004, and shortly afterward became one of the first publishers to join the Partner
Program. In addition to joining Google Books, Wisdom began using Google
AdWords to drive traffic to its site and Google Analytics to monitor the impact of its
online marketing initiatives.<br />
<br />
&quot;All of the Google services together work much better than a single one,&quot; reports Hallstein.
&quot;Traffic to our site has increased 74% since we started using Google Books, AdWords
and Analytics. Currently, Google provides 45% of our overall monthly traffic.&quot;<br />
<br />
A significant portion of the new traffic comes from outside of the United States. &quot;Since
we use Analytics, we can see that we get a ton of hits from Asia and Australia. We're
reaching an international audience we might not otherwise have been able to reach.&quot;<br />
<br />
The increased traffic has led to more exposure for Wisdom titles. &quot;Google Books
has picked up steam,&quot; explains Hallstein. &quot;In the beginning, we saw single-digit daily
impressions for our books; now we're up to four-digit impressions for some titles.&quot; In
fact, during a one-week period in September 2006, one of Wisdom's books, Ultimate
Healing: The Power of Compassion, made the top-ten list of most-searched titles in
Google Books. &quot;We were very excited to hear that,&quot; says Hallstein.<br />
<br />
Looking ahead, Wisdom plans to explore the possibility of selling online access to its
backlist titles through Google Books. Explains Hallstein, &quot;Some of our older books
have a following, but it's no longer economical to maintain them in print. We envision
using Google Books's online access feature to maintain access to these older
books, in keeping with our mission to make them available – while at the same time
reducing our impact on the environment.&quot;

<p><font size="-1">In the meantime, says Hallstein, the online accessibility of Wisdom titles through Google
        Book Search is enhancing their value, especially for the academic audience. &quot;A lot of
        our books are for the academic community. The search experience that Google provides
        is something that definitely adds value. Once in a while, I'll have a professor on the
        phone, and it's nice to be able to point them to our book in Google Books. It saves
        time for everyone, as the professor can explore a bit of the book online.&quot;<br />
<br />
        People who browse Google Books have the opportunity to buy books directly from
        the Wisdom website and online retailers. And according to Hallstein, online browsing
        also leads to increased sales in bookstores. &quot;We're not at all surprised when people learn
        about our books online, and then buy them offline.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>About Google Books</b>
</font> </p>
<p><font size="-1">Google Books enables authors
        and publishers to promote their books
        on Google. Google scans the full text of a
        partner's titles so that Google users can
        see books that match the topics they are
        searching on. When users click on a book
        search result, they're taken to a Googlehosted
        web page displaying a scanned
        image of the relevant page from the book.
        Each page also contains multiple &quot;Buy this
        Book&quot; links, which enable users to purchase
        the book from online retailers. Users may
        also see contextually targeted Google
        AdWords ads on these pages. Partners
        receive a share of the revenue generated
      from ads appearing on their content.</font></p></td>
