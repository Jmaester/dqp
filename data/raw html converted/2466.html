<p><font size="-1"><b>About Upper Access, Inc.</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Located in Hinesburg</font><font size="-1">, Vermont, Upper Access, Inc. is a small, independent
        publisher of non-fiction books, focusing specifically on books designed to improve
        the quality of life. So far, it has published 30 titles, covering topics ranging
        from herbal remedies to dealing with personal loss. A supporter of independent
        publishing, Upper Access also provides consulting services and business software
      for other publishers.</font></p>

<font color="#3366CC" size="-1">&quot;For all practical
                purposes, I consider it
                free publicity. And the best
                part is that a significant
                percentage of the sales are
                through my website, so
                they're at full retail price...

<p><font size="-1"> As a small publisher with limited funds for marketing, Upper Access, Inc.'s biggest
        challenge is spreading the word about its books.
        &quot;The more people know about my books, the more likely they are to buy them,&quot;
        says Steve Carlson, Publisher of Upper Access. &quot;Like many independent publishers,
        Upper Access is basically a one-person operation. I do everything I can to increase
        the amount of information people have.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Since Upper Access typically publishes one to three new titles per year, a second
        critical challenge is spurring interest in its older titles. &quot;For a small press our size,
        it's wonderful just to make a living publishing books that help people. We take the
        time to be sure that each title is the best in its field or subject area,&quot; says Carlson.
        &quot;But when you publish only a few books a year, most of your revenue comes from
        the backlist. A topic that was hot when a book was first published may no longer
        have the same broad appeal, so it's essential to keep these books visible to people
        who are interested.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Solution</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">        Carlson heard about Google Books in 2004 through a marketing newsletter
        for authors and publishers, and joined the Partner Program to increase exposure
        and jumpstart sales. Carlson closely tracks how customers discover Upper Access
        books, and after analyzing customer feedback, website visits and sales figures over
      a 10-month period, he was able to identify a pattern.</font></p>

<font color="#3366CC" size="-1">&quot;I can trace sales of 244 books directly to Google,

<p><font size="-1">&quot;I can trace sales of 244 books directly to Google, all sold from our site in the last
        10 months,&quot; reports Carlson. &quot;So far, we've seen 53 unique customers who say they
        found us through Google, so we're averaging 5.3 new customers a month. While
        these numbers may seem small, for a small publisher they're significant, especially
        since many of these orders come from organizations that buy multiple copies of a
      particular book. They represent continuing sales for the backlist.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;For instance, we have a book to help doctors notify people about the death of a
        patient. It was published back in '94, but a medical conference organizer found
        it this year, and every few months we see another order for 12-24 copies. Another
        example is a local history museum in Massachusetts that's been buying one of
        our books &ndash; it was never one of our bestsellers, but the information it contains
        fits perfectly for them. And we have a customer who's very interested in memory
        recovery &ndash; a hot topic in the mid-'90s &ndash; who found a book we published on the
        subject and now buys 10 copies at a time for her friends.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;My sense is that these are people who are looking for the best information on a
        topic, not for books necessarily &ndash; otherwise, they'd probably go to Amazon or their
        local bookstore. They may have just been searching on Google and happened upon a
        book. That's the value Google brings.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Upper Access has benefited not only from increased exposure and sales, but also a
        better return on investment.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;For all practical purposes, I consider it free publicity,&quot; says Carlson. &quot;And the best
        part is that a significant percentage of the sales are through my website, so they're
        at full retail price. With Amazon Advantage, you get less than 55 percent; with
        distributors, it's an even smaller cut. And with bookstore sales, you'll often see a
        10-30 percent return rate. But when people order directly, they don't return books.
        So these are ideal sales.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Upper Access has included its entire active catalog in Google Books, and
        plans to expand the partnership by submitting each new title upon publication.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>About Google Books</b>
</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Google Books enables publishers
      to promote their books on Google.
      Google scans the full text of participating
      publishers' titles so that Google users can
      see books that match the topics they are
      searching on. When users click on a book
      search result, they're taken to a Google hosted
      web page displaying a scanned
      image of the relevant page from the book.
      Each page also contains multiple &quot;Buy
      this Book&quot; links, which enable users to
      purchase the book from online retailers.
      Users may also see contextually targeted
      Google AdWords ads on these pages.
      Publishers will receive a share of the
      revenue generated from ads appearing on
    their content. </font></p></td>
