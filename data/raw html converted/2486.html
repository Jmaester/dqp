<h2>Human Resources</h2>
<p>The value Google places on our employees knows no bounds. We revolutionized search, and now we&rsquo;re redefining human resources in the way we work closely with our management teams to attract, hire, develop, and reward talented people. Google&rsquo;s HR team &ndash; which we call People Operations &ndash; is focused on bringing this discipline to the next level. The people who work with us have a wide variety of talents and experience, including HR, program management, marketing, team management, and analytical skills. Our common trait is that we share a commitment to preserving Google&rsquo;s uncommon culture as we continue to grow worldwide.</p>

<h4>Benefits &amp; perks</h4>
<p>Google employees have a wide variety of interests both inside and outside Google. We strive to design a unique benefits package that helps Googlers balance their busy lives and allows them to focus on what they love to do. To that end, the Benefits group has developed a wide variety of comprehensive programs to meet the various needs of our diverse population. Some of the programs we offer at our U.S. headquarters include a world-class children&rsquo;s center, a wellness center with on-site physicians, four full-service fitness centers, and massage services. We also provide gourmet meals, car wash, and laundry services, along with many other on-site services. We offer these perks in addition to our top-tier health plans and a generous 401(k) matching program.</p>

<div id="tab2">
<h4>Children's centers</h4>
<p>The value Google places on our employees knows no bounds. We revolutionized search, and now we're redefining human resources in the way we work closely with our management teams to attract, hire, develop, and reward talented people. Google's HR team &ndash; which we call People Operations &ndash; is focused on bringing this discipline to the next level as we continue to encourage our employees' creativity, personal growth and love of learning. We believe it's important to provide benefits to our employees' children as well. To that end, we've developed our Employee Child Development program by building high-quality children's centers located near our corporate headquarters. These family-focused centers integrate play-based philosophies into the curriculum, such as Resources for Infant Educarers (RIE), Program for Infant/Toddler Care (PITC), and the Reggio Emilia Approach. This program includes primary care-giving, small group size, and staff continuity, and is designed to meet the physical, cognitive, social, and emotional needs of children ages 3 months through 5 years.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab3">
<h4>Compensation &amp; analytics</h4>
<p>Compensation is the department that sets the parameters for each major pay element at Google: salaries, bonuses, and stock awards. The team ensures that Google pay, in total, meets our goal of being highly competitive with other companies. In addition to establishing both initial and ongoing rates of pay consistent with the Google philosophy, we also encourage, recognize, and reward outstanding &ndash; and astounding &ndash; levels of performance.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab4">
<h4>HR business partners &amp; generalists</h4>
<p>Human Resources Business Partners (sometimes called HR Generalists) are on the front line of servicing and interacting with our employees. We perform both hands-on and strategic roles in providing human resources expertise in employee relations, coaching/development, compensation, conflict management, organizational development, training, and more. Our team supports specific organizations, functions, and/or geographies. We embed ourselves within the business to work closely with management and employees on people-related issues. HR Business Partners are also instrumental in initiating and driving HR initiatives within those organizations, placing considerable focus on retention, scaling, and culture issues.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab5">
<h4>People technology &amp; operations</h4>
<p>The Human Resources Technology and Operations (HRTO) team designs, implements, and continuously evolves innovative technology tools that enable all aspects of Human Resources. Googlers around the world use these tools to access and manage people-related information. Our team also leverages these systems to administer core People Programs, including collecting and maintaining accurate data over the course of an employee&rsquo;s lifecycle, generating useful management information, and resolving end-user issues. These activities are complemented by a focus on optimizing operational processes, from problem definition and design to execution. HRTO jobs provide an excellent opportunity to make an impact across a range of human resources and business groups on a global basis.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab6">
<h4>Learning &amp; development</h4>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Learning and Leadership Development (LLD) team designs and implements innovative learning programs that support and develop the company&rsquo;s talent. Our team is a creative, dynamic, and collaborative group that is responsible for three integrated components of learning: the learning programs of Google University, leadership development, and talent management. We reach across all functions and geographic regions to support Googlers' personal and professional development in a way that contributes to their and our success. The breadth of our team&rsquo;s cultural, professional, and geographical histories greatly enriches us, and we continue to embrace diversity in our applicants' backgrounds.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab7">
<h4>People programs &amp; talent management</h4>
<p>Google&rsquo;s People Programs are geared to anticipate the demands and meet the requirements of the company&rsquo;s rapid expansion throughout the world. Our mission is to spread the word about Google&rsquo;s innovation, impact, and culture &ndash; and to encourage talented people to explore career opportunities with us. We help Google&rsquo;s recruiting and HR processes work effectively, extol Google&rsquo;s many virtues as an employer, engage in ongoing dialogs with university students and professors, and develop programs to promote and celebrate Google&rsquo;s culture of diversity.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab8">
<h4>Real estate &amp; workplace services</h4>
<p>Google's Real Estate and Workplace Services is renowned for building and maintaining unique, invigorating environments that allow our employees to focus on innovation. We make sure that Google employees inhabit the most dynamic, innovative - and functional - work settings possible. Our team of real estate, construction, facilities operations and services professionals are naturally inquisitive and energetic, and we thrive in a fast-paced environment - constantly searching for new ways to improve workplace efficiency.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab9">
<h4>Staffing</h4>
<p>Google Staffing is responsible for developing strategies to hire exceptionally talented people. This includes providing clients and candidates with enticing and compelling experiences throughout the hiring process. We&rsquo;re focused on building a scalable operation while working closely with management to develop creative, innovative solutions that support the company&rsquo;s growth.</p>
