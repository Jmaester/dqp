<td><h3><b>Partner Success Stories</b></h3><b>Transaction Publishers revives backlist, reaches
academic audience with online book previews</b>

<p><font size="-1">Transaction Publishers is widely recognized as a major independent academic
publisher of books, well-defined series, and serial publications in the social
sciences. Committed to reaching the widest possible audience for the best work
being done by social researchers, Transaction is located on the Rutgers University
campus in Piscataway, New Jersey, yet attracts a substantial international audience.
Established in 1962, Transaction publishes both original titles and a small number
of carefully chosen classics in the field. It currently has 4,000 books in print and
publishes between 120-150 titles per year.

President of Transaction Publishers</font>

<p><font size="-1">A forward-thinking academic publisher that serves a global readership in the social
sciences, Transaction's top priority is increasing exposure for its titles.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;I think of us as Mighty Mouse. We're not a big publisher in terms of size, but we have
a big impact. Our authors are relatively well-known, and our classics are written by
distinguished scholars who are recognized internationally,&quot; says Mary Curtis, President
of Transaction Publishers. &quot;The question is: How do we magnify that impact?&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">According to Curtis, today's market presents a special challenge to publishers. &quot;One of
the things that has frustrated me about book publishing is that for younger generations,
books are inert â€“ unless they're on the Internet, they're not there,&quot; explains Curtis. &quot;We
want more visibility for all our titles, and for our backlist to come alive.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Another important goal for Transaction is expanding the audience of educators who
might be interested in incorporating its books in their curricula. &quot;Professors and
academic associations need to know whether a particular book is appropriate for
students,&quot; says Curtis. &quot;But you can't tell unless you have a way to look at it.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Solution</b></font></p>
<table width="200" align="right" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1">
<tr>
<td><hr size="1" noshade color="c9d7f1" />
<font color="#3366cc" size="-1">&quot;By monitoring Google Books statistics,
we're able to meet demand because we can see it coming.
We get a book out again, and it gains momentum. If people
can't find a book, it dies. If they can, it builds.&quot;                </font>
<hr size="1" noshade color="c9d7f1" /></td>

<p><font size="-1">Transaction decided to join the Google Books Partner Program after being invited to
a demo at BookExpo America in 2004. &quot;When I heard the details, I thought it was
a terrific idea,&quot; says Curtis. &quot;From my perspective, unless you think what you have
isn't very good, why not let people preview it?&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Now, says Curtis, Transaction's backlist &quot;is more alive than ever.&quot; Titles like The
Dark Side of Love: The Positive Side of Negative Feelings, which sold well in 1999
but &quot;went to sleep,&quot; are reaching new audiences. The Discovery of Grounded
Theory, which was published in 1967, has received 118,319 page views and
hundreds of &quot;Buy this book&quot; clicks since it went live on Google Books.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Other backlist books have attracted so much interest that Transaction has decided
to republish them. &quot;By monitoring Google Books statistics, we're able to meet
demand because we can see it coming,&quot; says Curtis. &quot;We get a book out again, and
it gains momentum. If people can't find a book, it dies. If they can, it builds.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">In addition to enjoying increased online visibility and a backlist revival, Transaction
is reaping benefits from giving its academic customers a way to preview books.
&quot;There are definite correlations when I look at books with high numbers of page
views and those getting heavily adopted and sold for courses,&quot; reports Curtis.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Offering previews has also proven to be a successful marketing strategy for other
audiences. In a recent marketing initiative, for instance, Transaction sent an email
to Jewish libraries to promote The Jewish Divide Over Israel, including a link to
preview the book in Google Books. &quot;We sold a lot of books,&quot; says Curtis.
&quot;And I'm sure we sold more because people could actually see the book.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Transaction has now included the majority of its catalog in Google Books and
plans to continue pointing customers to the service for previews of its books.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;This fall, we're going to promote Google Books in our meetings with
professional associations like the American Sociological Association and the African
Studies Association,&quot; says Curtis. &quot;Every meeting we go to, someone asks us about
a book that we don't have on hand. Now we can tell people they can find our books
on Google Books.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>About Google Books</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Google Books enables publishers to promote their books on Google. Google scans the full text of participating publishers' titles so that Google users can see books that match the topics they are searching on. When users click on a book search result, they're taken to a Google-hosted web page displaying a scanned image of the relevant page from the book. Each page also contains multiple &quot;Buy this Book&quot; links, which enable users to purchase the book from online retailers. Users may also see contextually targeted Google AdWords ads on these pages. Publishers will receive a share of the revenue generated from ads appearing on their content. </font></p></td>
