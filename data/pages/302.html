    <ul class="faq-list item-list"><li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question first"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="809">What is Top News? </a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>If you want the “classic” Digg experience, Top News is the Digg you know and love. This is the global zeitgeist of popular content on the web as voted by the Digg community. While My News can deliver trusted news from mainstream and small publishers alike, Top News will still highlight the spirit of the Digg community</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="808">How is the new Digg different than the old one? </a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>The biggest change is the amount of effort we put into overhauling the platform – the new Digg is faster in every way: submitting articles, loading pages, and Digging content! </p>

	<p>We also put a lot of thought into how people consume news and wanted to make it easy to share and view what your friends were reading – think of My News as your personal online newspaper where you will get the best web content filtered by the people and sources you trust. This is just the beginning of the changes we’re making, so stay tuned!</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="807">Are there more features coming to the new Digg?</a></li>
<li class="answer last">	<p>You bet! We’ll be collecting your feedback and putting your ideas into action right away, so come back to see what we’ve tweaked. Please send us any <a href="/contact">feedback</a> you have on what&#8217;s working for you, what&#8217;s missing or any other thoughts you have. </p></li>

    <ul class="faq-list item-list"><li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question first"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="715">What is My News?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>My News is one of the new features we&#8217;re most excited about in the new Digg. This is where you can get a personalized news experience filtered by your friends, the people you like, and the sources you trust for content. One of the reasons we created My News is because we found that how relevant or interesting an article is to you is directly related to how much you trust where it came from. News means different things to different people, but generally articles are interesting because the story was recommended by your friend, came from a blogger you really like, or a source you really trust.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="716">How do you determine what is displayed in My News?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Stories show up in My News only if they&#8217;ve been Dugg or commented on by Digg users that you&#8217;re following. There will never be a story in My News that hasn&#8217;t been acted on by one of the Digg users you&#8217;ve followed.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="717">Why is my My News page blank? How can I get more articles in My News?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Your My News page will be blank or won’t have many stories if you are not following active Digg users. Make My News more interesting by finding users to follow; click on the ‘Find People’ link in the left menu of your My News page – there you can connect your Twitter, Google, or Facebook accounts to see all of your friends that are on Digg. You can also browse through the list of <a href="http://digg.com/people">Suggested People</a> by category to find interesting Tastemakers and Publishers. </p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="718">How can I find more Digg users to follow, after the first time I log in, so that they show up in My News?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>You can always make My News more interesting by finding and folliowing more Digg users via the &#8216;Find People&#8217; page. Click on the &#8216;Find People&#8217; link in the left menu of your My News page &#8211; there you can connect your Twitter, Google, or Facebook accounts to see all of your friends that are on Digg. You can also browse through the list of Suggested People by category to find interesting Tastemakers and Publishers. Follow as many people as you like &#8211; you can always unfollow Digg users that aren&#8217;t interesting later.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="720">How do I remove a saved story?</a></li>
<li class="answer last">	<p>Clicking on the &#8216;Saved&#8217; link a second time will revert it back to &#8216;Save&#8217; and remove it from your Saved Stories page.</p></li>

    <ul class="faq-list item-list"><li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question first"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="20">What’s the best way to find interesting stuff?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Digg is organized into groups of categories based on topics. First, go to the <a href="http://digg.com">homepage</a>, where you’ll find the best of the best according to the Digg community. From there, click around on some of the topics listed at the top (Technology, World &amp; Business, etc.) and you’ll see the top stories in each individual category.</p>

	<p>If you’re more of the get in early type, check out our expansive <a href="http://digg.com/all/upcoming/recommended">Upcoming</a> section for stories that haven’t been promoted yet.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="80">What is Digg?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>Digg is a place for people to discover and share content found on the web. From the biggest online destination to the most obscure blog, Digg surfaces the best stuff as voted on by our users. You won’t find editors at Digg — we’re here to provide a place where people collectively determine the value of content. In doing so, we’re changing the way people consume information online.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="82">Can I change the Digg homepage to only show certain categories?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>If you’re just not interested in some of the topics that get promoted to the Digg homepage feel free to personalize your Digg experience. First, make sure you’re logged in. You can change the default view of your homepage by clicking on the Customize button, which is located on the top navigation bar next to “Images”. Once you’re on the customize page simply deselect the topics you’d prefer not to see on your homepage. Also, any specific topic or category can be set as your default homepage — at the bottom of the customize page, there are two drop down menus for selecting both topic and specific media types.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="83">How do I report a bug, problem or abuse?</a></li>
<li class="answer last"><p>If you encounter a bug, abusive behavior or other problem on the site, please use our <a href="http://digg.com/contact/">Contact</a> page to let us know what’s happening — Digg’s support team is available to make sure the community’s concerns are heard and responded to quickly.</p>

    <ul class="faq-list item-list"><li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question first"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="709">How do I follow a Digger?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Simple! Go to that Digger&#8217;s profile and in the upper right corner next to their name you&#8217;ll see a green icon. Just click that icon and you&#8217;re done! Similarly, if you&#8217;d like to unfollow someone, click that icon again and we&#8217;ll remove them from your list.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="710">Can I prevent someone from following me?</a></li>

<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="711">Can I block a user?</a></li>

</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="769">What information does Digg access when I connect a 3rd party (Twitter, Facebook, Google) account? </a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Never fear &#8211; we (the people at Digg) never see any of your personal information when we connect to one of these services. All connections are handled via the respective service&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span> and each service will request your explicit permission before providing us with the information we need to see if any of your connections or friends also have accounts on Digg. Once we&#8217;ve received that information, you can choose which of your friends you&#8217;d like to follow on Digg.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="787">I entered all my log in information from Twitter, Facebook and Google, but Digg indicates I have 0 contacts in all three.</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Hmmm. If your contacts aren&#8217;t listed here, it&#8217;s likely that your friends haven&#8217;t signed up for Digg yet. It&#8217;s on you now &#8211; invite them! </p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="788">Is it OK to have more than one account on Digg?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Well, that depends. If you&#8217;d like to maintain a couple of accounts for different business or personal use, that&#8217;s fine. However, please don&#8217;t use multiple accounts to Digg the same content &#8211; that goes against the spirit of our community. </p></li>

<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="768">Where do I find my saved stories?</a></li>

<li class="answer">	<p>Submitting duplicate stories is definitely not cool, so we ask folks to Digg the original story instead of submitting a duplicate. Of course, there will be similar stories from different sources that are submitted to Digg. In those cases, we let our users determine whether a story is a duplicate or if it offers a fresh perspective. </p></li>

<li class="answer">	<p>While it might be tempting to hurl back an insult, that just adds fuel to the fire so let us deal with abusive commenters.

<li class="answer"><p>Simply click the word “bury” on the story just under the description. Done. Once you bury the story, you’ll still be able to interact with it (comment, share etc), but you won’t be able to Digg it or unbury it, so be judicious.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="1079">Can burying be abused? </a></li>

<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="93">How can I connect my existing Digg account to Facebook?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>Connecting your Digg account to Facebook is super simple. Go to your <a href="http://digg.com/settings/facebook">Profile Settings</a> and choose "Connect". Done and done!</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="95">What personal data from my Facebook account is shared with Digg?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>Currently, only a user’s full name and profile image is shared. You can choose whether to use your full name from Facebook on Digg via the <a href="http://digg.com/settings/about">About Me</a> settings page.</p>
<p>You can also choose to sync your Digg and Facebook default profile images via your Digg <a href="http://digg.com/settings/image">profile settings</a>. If you choose to sync those images, updating your Facebook profile pic will update your Digg account.</p>

<li class="answer">	<p>First, make sure you added an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed; we&#8217;ve heard from folks who have added the plain <span class="caps">URL</span> of their site or blog &#8211; this won&#8217;t work. Second, note that it takes up to 4 hours for the system to begin the import of your feed. And, third, make sure you post a new item to your blog or site as our <span class="caps">RSS</span> importer is not retroactive.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="767">Can you give a sample of the hidden comment code for verifying the RSS feed inclusion?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>To include the verification key as a hidden <span class="caps">HTML</span> comment, you need to have access to the <span class="caps">HTML</span> editor option of the content management system you use to manage your site; we&#8217;re not able to provide the comment code for you. If you don&#8217;t have access to the <span class="caps">CMS</span>, simply create a post and include the key somewhere in the body of the post. Give us a couple of hours to complete the process and then delete the post if you&#8217;d like. </p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="780">How can I add a thumbnail to my RSS feed? </a></li>
<li class="answer">	<ol>
		<li>For atom feeds, use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag as a child node of the <code>&lt;feed&gt;</code> tag (for feed-wide thumbs) or as a child of the <code>&lt;entry&gt;</code> tag (for entry-specific thumbs)</li>
		<li>For <span class="caps">RSS</span>, you can use the Atom namespace and add the same element, like this <code>&lt;atom:link rel=&quot;thumbnail&quot; ...&gt;</code> (define the atom namespace globally in the feed, like this <code>&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot; xmlns:atom=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot; ...&gt;</code>)</li>
		<li><span class="caps">RSS</span> has a <code>&lt;thumbnail&gt;</code> element in the MediaRSS (<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" title="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/">http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/</a>) namespace. Similar to the technique above.</li>

<li class="answer last">	<p>Only verified <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds can be added to your profile &#8211; this means that the person adding the feed must be able to show ownership over that <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed. To add and verify an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed, go to the Account Settings options (&#8216;Settings&#8217; link at the top of any Digg page) and click on &#8216;Import Feeds&#8217; in the left menu. Paste in the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed you would like to add to your profile and follow the instructions to verify your feed.

<li class="answer"><p>It depends. The promotion or burying of stories is managed by an algorithm developed by Digg, and there is no specific threshold of Diggs or buries required to promote or bury a story. Instead, our algorithm takes several factors into consideration, including (but not limited to) the number and diversity of Diggs, buries, the time the story was submitted and the topic.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="106">There are stories with hundreds of Diggs — why haven’t they been promoted?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>Our algorithm takes several factors into consideration, including (but not limited to) the number and diversity of Diggs, user reports, the time the story was submitted and the topic. Though we cannot go into further detail about the algorithm, we can say that one of the keys to promotion is the element of diversity, as mentioned above. Without diversity, a story will not be promoted.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="107">Can I un-Digg or unbury a story?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>Changed your mind? You can un-Digg a story by logging in and clicking My Profile. Find the story in the Recent Activity section (or click the History tab) and you’ll find an un-Digg button next to each item. You can’t unbury a story, however.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="108">Why don’t you show who buried a story?</a></li>
<li class="answer last"><p>Simple: We like to focus on the positive and don’t want to spark sandbox fights between users. What you bury is your own personal decision, and our math takes care of deciding when a story will be buried.</p>

<li class="answer"><p>Digg is a social media site by definition, so sharing a certain amount of information is important. Your Diggs, submissions, comments and favorites are all important contributions to the Digg community. That said, you can keep personal information private if you like by updating your <a href="http://digg.com/settings">profile settings</a>.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="115">Why is my private information (age, location, name) showing on my profile?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>First, make sure your settings reflect your desire to keep certain information private by logging in and clicking the <a href="http://digg.com/settings">Settings</a> tab in your profile area. You can share your age, along with other information (such as your full name and location) to everyone, just your friends or nobody at all.</p>
<p>Note that if you’ve chosen to display certain information to nobody, you will still see it when you’re logged in and viewing your own profile. However, it won’t be shown to anyone else on the site. You can confirm this by logging out and viewing your profile.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="651">Why is my personal info still showing up in other search engine results?</a></li>
<li class="answer last"><p>When you've opted to remove private information from your public Digg profile (such as your full name, age, and location), sometimes it takes search engines a few days for their results to reflect the changes that you've made. Digg has no direct control over the amount of time that it takes for an external site to update this information, so the length of the delay may vary.</p>
<p>Please note that deactivating your Digg account doesn't speed up this process. If you're concerned about private information being displayed in search engine results, we recommend that you change your account's privacy settings via <a href="http://digg.com/settings" title="http://digg.com/settings">http://digg.com/settings</a>.</p>

<li class="answer">	<p>Not at all. You can still Digg an ad, but instead of burying it you&#8217;ll hide it instead. Through your participation, successful ads will be shown more often and unsuccessful ads will get voted out of rotation. Digg Ads function separately from user submitted Digg content.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="732">Is this how the ads are going to look and where they&#039;re going to be in the new Digg?</a></li>
<li class="answer">	<p>Yes. Although, as with all of our features, we will be iterating and improving based on user feedback. Our goal is to continue to provide great advertising that both Digg users and advertisers find useful. Look for us to continue to push the envelope and create innovative and relevant ads for our Digg users.</p></li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="119">Why would I Digg or bury an ad?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>The goal of Digg Ads is to encourage advertisers to create content that is as interesting as organic Digg content. By Digging or burying the Digg Ads, you are helping us determine which ads to show to more people, and which ads to show less frequently. Currently, when you Digg a Digg Ad, it does not show up in your Digg history, though this may be an option in the future. Digging or burying Digg Ads helps us continue to improve the overall Digg experience. We give each advertiser a content score based in part on the community's Diggs and buries. Advertisers with higher content scores will pay less and their ads will be shown to more people. Also, when you bury an ad you won't see the ad again (as long as you're logged in).</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="120">How does a Digg Ad get to the homepage?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>Digg Ads are served into fixed placements on various pages, including the Digg Homepage. The Digg Ads do not flow down the river like other organic content. Instead, they rotate into a fixed placement with a frequency that is determined based on their content score, the bid, and other factors. Unlike organic content, Digg Ads can show up on the Digg Homepage immediately – there is no promotion required. A key difference between Digg Ads and organic content is that Digg Ads are not promoted to the homepage – they can show up there with as few as one Digg – but the frequency each ad is displayed will increase or decrease based on its content score and other factors.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="123">Do Diggs on a Digg Ad count toward the organic version of the story?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>No, they don't count. For example, if a Digg Ad gets 1000 Diggs, and then that same link is submitted organically, the organic story will start with only 1 Digg, while the Digg Ad version of the story will continue to exist with 1000 Diggs. So the Diggs on the Digg Ad version will not count toward organic homepage promotion, and organic Diggs will not count toward the Digg Ad. The system is designed this way to ensure a level playing field for all organic content.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="122">Can I submit content that is also used for a Digg Ad?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>If you feel the content of the ad itself would make a great Digg submission (as long as it is content not simply an e-commerce link), you're welcome to submit the ad to Digg as a normal story. As always, you'll be held to the <a href="/tou">Digg Terms of Use</a> so be sure the ad itself is not in violation (remember that Digg Ads can be of a commercial nature, but organic submissions to Digg that are primarily of a commercial nature are likely to be in violation of our TOU).</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="118">What are DiggAds?</a></li>
<li class="answer"><p>DiggAds is a new advertising platform that provides an interactive advertising experience for the user; you can Digg the ads you like and bury those you don't. Through your participation, successful ads will be shown more often and unsuccessful ads will get voted out of rotation. DiggAds function separately from user submitted Digg content.</p>
</li>
<li class="question faq-dt-hide-answer faq-question"><a href="/faq" class="faq-track active" rel="802">How does a Digg Ad get to the homepage?</a></li>
