      <h2>Searching Google Scholar</h2>

        <p><b>How do I search by author?</b></p>
        <p>Use the "author:" operator, e.g., author:"d knuth" or author:"donald e knuth". See our <a href="refinesearch.html">Advanced Search Tips</a> for more information.</p>

        <p><b>How do I search by title?</b></p>
        <p>Put the paper's title in quotations: "A History of the China Sea."</p>

        <p><b>How do I sort by date?</b></p>
        <p>Alas, we don't currently offer a sort by date. If you want to find recent papers, select the date range from the dropdown menu labeled <em>anytime</em> under the search box.</p>
        <p>You can also receive newly added search results by email.  To sign up for email updates, do a search as usual and click on the envelope icon on the green bar.</p>

        <p><b>How do I search for court opinions?</b></p>
        <p>Select <em>Legal opinions and journals</em> on the <a href="/schhp?hl=en">Google Scholar homepage</a> or in the dropdown menu on the search results page.</p>

        <p><b>How do I search for court opinions from a particular jurisdiction?</b></p>
        <p>You can select specific jurisdictions on the <a href="/advanced_scholar_search?hl=en">Advanced Search page</a>.</p>

        <p><b>What does the "Related articles" link do?</b></p>
        <p>It finds documents similar to the given search result.</p>

        <p><b>How do I search for papers in specific publications?</b></p>
        <p>Within the <a href="/advanced_scholar_search?hl=en">Advanced Search page</a>, you can specify keywords which must appear in both the article and the publication name. See our <a href="refinesearch.html">Advanced Search Tips</a> for more information.</p>

        <p><b>How do I search by category?</b></p>
        <p>From the <a href="/advanced_scholar_search?hl=en">Advanced Search page</a>, you can search for scholarly literature within several broad areas of research. You can also limit your search to <em>legal opinions and journals</em>.</p>

      <br>
      <a name="alerts"></a>
      <h2>Email Alerts</h2>

        <p><b>How do I sign up for email alerts?</b></p>
        <p>Do a search for the topic of interest, e.g. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=m+theory&hl=en&btnG=Search&as_sdt=2001&as_sdtp=on">M Theory</a>, click on the envelope icon on the green bar below the search box, and click "Create alert". We'll then periodically email you newly published papers that match your search criteria.</p>

        <p><b>Do I need a Google account to receive email alerts?</b></p>
        <p>No. If you're <em>not</em> signed in to a Google account, you can enter an email address of your choice. Then, we'll email you a verification link, which you'll need to click in order to start receiving alerts.</p>

        <p><b>How do I get notified when my papers are cited?</b></p>
        <p>Search for common spellings of your name in references, e.g., <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=sw-hawking+OR+hawking-sw+OR+s-hawking+OR+hawking-s&hl=en&btnG=Search&as_sdt=2001&as_sdtp=on">sw-hawking OR hawking-sw OR s-hawking OR hawking-s</a>. If you get many results for different people that share your name, try adding last names of your co-authors or topical keywords to your search. You can tweak your search terms and preview a sample of results on the alert creation page.</p>

        <p><b>How do I get notified when a particular paper is cited?</b></p>
        <p>Search for the title of your paper, e.g. <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22Anti+de+Sitter+space+and+holography%22&hl=en&btnG=Search&as_sdt=2001&as_sdtp=on">"Anti de Sitter space and holography"</a>, click on the "Cited by" link at the bottom of the search result, and then click on the envelope icon on the green bar below the search box.</p>

        <p><b>How do I get notified of new papers published by my <strike>competitors</strike>, err, respected colleagues?</b></p>
        <p>Do a search by author, e.g., <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:s-hawking&hl=en&btnG=Search&as_sdt=2001&as_sdtp=on">author:s-hawking</a>, and click on the mighty envelope. Add co-author names or topical keywords if necessary.</p>

        <p><b>How often do you send the alerts?</b></p>
        <p>We send the alerts right after we add new papers to Google Scholar.  This is generally done several times a week, except that our search robots meticulously observe holidays.</p>

        <p><b>How do I unsubscribe?</b></p>
        <p>There's a link to cancel the alert at the bottom of every notification email.</p>

        <p><b>How do I change my alerts?</b></p>
        <p>If you created alerts using a Google account, you can manage them all <a href="/scholar_alerts?view_op=list_alerts">here</a>. If you're not using a Google account, you'll need to unsubscribe from the individual alerts and subscribe to the new ones.</p>

      <a name="export"></a>
      <h2>Citation Export</h2>

        <p><b>How can I add the full citation of a result on Google Scholar to my bibliography manager?</b></p>
        <p>Visit the <a href="/scholar_preferences?hl=en">Scholar Preferences</a> page and select your preferred citation format in the "Bibliography Manager" section. We currently support RefWorks, RefMan, EndNote, and BibTeX. Once you've saved your preferences, you can import a citation by clicking on the appropriate import link in your Google Scholar search results.</p>

        <p><b>I wrote a program to download lots of search results, but you blocked my computer from accessing Google Scholar. Can you raise the limit?</b></p>
        <p>Err, no, please respect our robots.txt when you access Google Scholar using automated software. As the wearers of crawler's shoes and webmaster's hat, we cannot recommend adherence to web standards highly enough.</p>

        <p><b>How do I get bulk access to records in Google Scholar?</b></p>
        <p>Sorry, we're unable to provide bulk access. You'll need to make an arrangement directly with the source of the data you're interested in. Keep in mind that a lot of the records in Google Scholar come from commercial subscription services.</p>

        <p><b>Can I see more than 1,000 search results?</b></p>
        <p>Sorry, we can only show up to 1,000 results for any particular search query. Try a different query to get more results.</p>

      <br>
      <a name="coverage"></a>
      <h2>Content Coverage</h2>

        <p><b>What do you include in Google Scholar?</b></p>
        <p>Google Scholar includes journal and conference papers, theses and dissertations, academic books, pre-prints, abstracts, technical reports and other scholarly literature from all broad areas of research. You'll find works from a wide variety of academic publishers, professional societies and university repositories, as well as scholarly articles available anywhere across the web. Google Scholar also includes court opinions and patents.</p>

        <p><b>Do you cover Pubmed? JSTOR? Elsevier?</b></p>
        <p>We index research articles and abstracts from most major academic publishers and repositories worldwide, including both free and subscription sources. To check current coverage of a specific source in Google Scholar, search for a sample of their article titles in quotes.</p>
        <p><em>While we try to be comprehensive, it isn't possible to guarantee uninterrupted coverage of any particular source. We index articles from sources all over the web and link to these websites in our search results. If one of these websites becomes unavailable to our search robots or to a large number of web users, we have no choice but to remove it from Google Scholar until it becomes available again.</em></p>

        <p><b>How complete is your coverage?</b></p>
        <p>Our meticulous search robots generally try to index every paper from every website they visit, including most major sources and also many lesser known ones.</p>
        <p>That said, Google Scholar is primarily a search of <em>academic papers</em>. Shorter articles, such as book reviews, news sections, editorials, announcements and letters, may or may not be included. Untitled documents and documents without authors are usually not included. Website URLs that aren't available to our search robots or to the majority of web users are, obviously, not included either. Nor do we include websites that require you to sign up for an account, install a browser plugin, watch four colorful ads, and turn around three times and say coo-coo before you can read the listing of titles scanned at 10&nbsp;DPI from a print on Charmin... You get the idea, we cover academic papers from sensible websites.</p>

        <p><b>How come a search for [site:example.gov] returns far fewer results than I expect?</b></p>
        <p>That's usually because we index many of these papers from other websites, such as the websites of their primary publishers. The "site:" operator currently only searches the primary version of each paper.</p>
        <p>It could also be that the papers are located on examplejournals.gov, not on example.gov. Please make sure you're searching for the "right" website.</p>
        <p>That said, the best way to check coverage of a specific source is to search for a sample of their papers using the title of the paper.</p>

        <p><b>Which specific journals do you cover?</b></p>
        <p>Ahem, we index papers, not journals. You should also ask about our coverage of universities, research groups, proteins, seminal breakthroughs, and other dimensions that are of interest to users. All such questions are best answered by searching for a statistical sample of papers that has the property of interest - journal, author, protein, etc. Many coverage comparisons are available if you search for [allintitle:"google scholar"], but some of them are more statistically valid than others.</p>

        <p><b>Which court opinions do you include?</b></p>
        <p>Currently, Google Scholar allows you to search and read opinions for US state appellate and supreme court cases since 1950, US federal district, appellate, tax and bankruptcy courts since 1923 and US Supreme Court cases since 1791. In addition, it includes citations for cases cited by indexed opinions or journal articles which allows you to find influential cases (usually older or international) which are not yet online or publicly available.</p>
        <p><em>Legal opinions in Google Scholar are provided for informational purposes only and should not be relied on as a substitute for legal advice from a licensed lawyer. Google does not warrant that the information is complete or accurate.</em></p>

        <p><b>How frequently do you update Google Scholar?</b></p>
        <p>We normally add new papers several times a week. However, updates to existing records take 3-6 months to a year or longer, because in order to update our records, we need to first recrawl them from the source website. For many larger websites, the speed at which we can update their records is limited by the crawl rate that they allow.</p>

      <h2>Inclusion and Corrections</h2>

        <p><b>The description of my article is wrong and I am appropriately irritated. How do I correct it?</b></p>
        <p>We apologize, and we assure you the error was unintentional. Automated extraction of information from articles in diverse fields can be tricky, so an error sometimes sneaks through. Please write to the owner of the website where the erroneous search result is coming from, and encourage them to provide correct bibliographic data to us, as described in the technical guidelines <a href="inclusion.html">here</a>. Once the data is corrected on their website, it usually takes 3-6 months to a year or longer for it to be updated in Google Scholar. We appreciate your help and your patience.</p>

        <p><b>How do I add my papers to Google Scholar?</b></p>
        <p>If you can't find your papers when you search for them by title and by author, please refer your publisher to our <a href="publishers.html">general information</a> and <a href="inclusion.html">technical guidelines</a>. You can also deposit your papers into your institutional repository or put their PDF versions on your personal website, but please follow your publisher's requirements when you do so. See our <a href="inclusion.html">technical guidelines</a> for more details on the inclusion process. We normally add new papers several times a week; however, it might take us some time to crawl larger websites, and corrections to already included papers can take 3-6 months to a year or longer.</p>

        <p><b>My citation counts have gone down. Help!</b></p>
        <p>Google Scholar generally reflects the state of the web as it is <em>currently</em> visible to our search robots and to the majority of users. When you're searching for relevant papers to read, you wouldn't want it any other way! If your citation counts have gone down, chances are that either your paper or papers that cite it have either disappeared from the web entirely, or have become unavailable to our search robots, or, perhaps, have been reformatted in a way that made it difficult for our automated software to identify their bibliographic data and references. If you wish to correct this, you'll need to identify the specific documents with indexing problems and get them fixed as described elsewhere in this section.</p>

        <p><b>I have noticed an error in a court opinion you are providing. What I can do to help fix it?</b></p>
        <p>Please do <a href="http://www.google.com/support/scholar/bin/request.py?contact_type=general">let us know</a>. Please include the URL for the opinion, the corrected information and a source where we can verify the correction.</p>
        <p><i>We're only able to make corrections to court opinions that are hosted on our own website. For corrections to academic papers, books, dissertations and other third-party material, click on the search result in question and contact the owner of the website where the document came from. For corrections to books from Google Book Search, click on the book's title and locate the link to provide feedback at the bottom of the book's page.</i></p>

      <h2>General Questions</h2>

        <p><b>What are the results marked [citation] and why can't I click on them?</b></p>
        <p>These are articles which other scholarly articles have referred to, but which we haven't found online. To exclude them from your search results, select <em>at least summaries</em> from the dropdown menu labeled <em>include citations</em>.</p>

        <p><b>I just found a promising abstract in the Journal of Prosimian Dialectical Reasoning! Can I read the full text of the article for free?</b></p>
        <p>Maybe.</p>
        <p>First, click on links labeled <em>[PDF]</em> or <em>[HTML]</em> to the right of the search result's title. Also, check out the <em>All versions</em> link at the bottom of the search result.</p>
        <p>Second, if you're affiliated with a university, using a computer on campus will often let you access your library's online subscriptions. Look for links labeled with your library's name to the right of the search result's title. Also, see if there's a link to the full text on the publisher's page with the abstract.</p>
        <p>Keep in mind that final published versions are often only available to subscribers, and that some articles are not available online at all. Good luck!</p>

        <p><b>How come you're forgetting my preference settings?</b></p>
        <p>Technically, your web browser remembers your preference settings in a "cookie" on your computer's disk, and sends this cookie to our website along with every search. Check that your browser isn't configured to discard our cookies. Also, check if disabling various proxies or overly helpful privacy settings does the trick. Either way, your preferences are stored on your computer, not on our servers, so a long hard look at your browser's preferences or internet options should help cure the machine's forgetfulness.</p>

        <p><b>Why are you asking us to &quot;Stand on the shoulders of giants&quot;? Are you really giants?</b></p>
        <p>Not even close. That phrase is our acknowledgement that much of scholarly research involves building on what others have already discovered. It's taken from Sir Isaac Newton's famous quote, &quot;If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.&quot;</p>
