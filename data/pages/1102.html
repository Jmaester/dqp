<h3 class="pageHeader">Terms of Service Highlights</h3>
<p>At Google we recognise that knowing your legal rights and responsibilities is important, including when you use our services and products.  We spell out those rights and responsibilities in our <a href="../../TOS?hl=en">Terms of Service</a>.  You should read the Terms. Really. We also know that legal documents can be boring and that you might not always do what you “should.”  So, we’ve tried to give you the basics here.</p>


<p>Remember, the <a href="../../TOS?hl=en">Terms</a> are what you are agreeing to when you sign up or use a Google Service and this summary is not a substitute for reading the actual terms themselves. Ignorantia legis neminem excusat and all that.</p>

<b>Scope</b>

<p>This notice offers highlights of the full Google <a href="../../TOS?hl=en">Terms of Service</a>, which describe in detail the terms that apply for the use of Google's products, services and websites (collectively, Google's "services") worldwide. You can also get more information about the legal terms for specific Google services in the navigation bar to the left of this notice.</p>


<b>Your relationship with Google</b>
<ul>
<li>Whenever you use our services it’s under the terms of a legal contract with Google.
<li>This contract is made up of the Terms of Use and the Legal Notices for the services you’re using.
<li>We will make any additional Legal Notices available to you when you sign up for the service concerned so you’ll know they apply.
<li>If you misbehave, we may terminate our agreement with you.  This might result in your access to some or all of our services being disabled.  Don’t say you weren’t warned.
<li>We may also decide to stop providing services to you.  While we don’t plan to discontinue any service, we reserve the right to.
<li>You can terminate your agreement with us at any time by closing your account for the services you use.  We’ll be sorry to see you go, but you can come back anytime!
</ul>

<b>About your responsibilities</b>
<ul>
<li>Remember that when you use our services, you remain responsible for your conduct and actions, and for any content you’ve submitted to us.
<li>Generally, our services are only for you personally to use.  If you want to redistribute a service, copy it, sell it or such like you’ll have to get our express permission first.
<li>It’s your responsibility to look after your account security and passwords.  Activities that happen on your account are your responsibility.
</ul>

<b>About your content</b>
<ul>
<li>Google does not assert any ownership rights in your content.  What belongs to you, stays yours.
<li>We do require that you give us a licence to the content you post so that we can host it and, if you ask us to, make it available to others.
<li>Content on our services usually isn’t ours.  We may not monitor what we host or link to, although in some limited cases we might. Don’t be surprised if you see something you don’t like.  You can always tell us about it or stop looking.
</ul>

<b>About Google’s services</b>
<ul>
<li>We are constantly changing and improving our services.  If you’re scared of change, this isn’t the place for you.
<li>We hope that you will enjoy using our services, but we don’t make any specific promises about them being able to work wonders for you, or about their reliability or availability.
<li>Some services contain secret sauce.  The secret sauce is supposed to stay secret.  Please don’t disclose our confidential information.
<li>Google isn’t responsible for things that might happen to you as a consequence of your use of our services.  Unfortunately, everything in life has some risk.  We think the benefits are worth it.
