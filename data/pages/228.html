          <h1>Advanced Scholar Search Tips</h1>
          <div class="content">

<p>You can increase the accuracy and effectiveness of your searches on Google Scholar by adding &quot;operators&quot; that fine-tune your search terms. In some cases, you can add operators right in the Google Scholar search box; other times, you'll want to use the <a href="/advanced_scholar_search">Advanced Scholar Search page</a>.</p>
      <p>Here are the most common Google Scholar operators:</p>
      <p><a href="#author">Author Search</a> - 
          <a href="#pubrestrict">Publication Restrict</a> - 
          <a href="#daterestrict">Date Restrict</a> - 
          <a href="#legalrestrict">Legal opinions and journals</a> - 
          <a href="#jurisrestrict">Jurisdiction Restrict</a> - 
        <a href="#tips">Other Operators</a></p>
      <h2><a name="author"></a>Author search</h2>
<p> Author search is one of the most effective ways to find a specific paper. If you know who wrote the paper you're looking for, you can simply add their last name to your search terms. </p>      <p><b> For example:</b><br>
          The search [<a href="/scholar?q=friedman+regression">friedman regression</a>] returns papers on the subject of regression written by people named Friedman. If you want to search on an author's full name, or last name and initials, enter the name in quotes: [<a href="/scholar?q=%22jh+friedman%22">"jh friedman"</a>]. </p>
      <p> When a word is both a person's name and a common noun, you might want to use the "author:" operator. This operator only affects the search term that immediately follows it, and there must be no space between "author:" and your search term. </p>
      <p><b> For example:</b><br>
  [<a href="/scholar?q=author%3Aflowers">author:flowers</a>] returns papers written by people with the name Flowers, whereas [<a href="/scholar?q=flowers+%2Dauthor%3Aflowers">flowers -author:flowers</a>] returns papers about flowers, and ignores papers written by people with the name Flowers (a minus in front of a search term excludes results that contain this search term). </p>
      <p> You may use the operator with an author's full name in quotes to further refine your search. Try to use initials rather than full first names, because some sources indexed in Google Scholar only provide the initials. </p>
      <p><b> For example: <br>
      </b> To find papers by Donald E. Knuth, you could try [<a href="/scholar?q=author%3A%22d+knuth%22">author:"d knuth"</a>], [<a href="/scholar?q=author%3A%22de+knuth%22">author:"de knuth"]</a>, or [<a href="/scholar?q=author%3A%22donald+e+knuth%22">author:"donald e knuth"</a>].       </p>
      <h2><a name="pubrestrict" id="pubrestrict"></a>Publication restrict</b></h2>
      
<p>(This option is only available on the <a href="/advanced_scholar_search">Advanced Scholar Search page</a>.) </p>
      <p> A publication-restricted search only returns results with specific words from a specific publication.</p>
      <p><b> For example:</b><b><br>
      </b> If you want to search the <i>Journal of Finance </i>for articles about mutual funds, you might start like this: </p>
      <div align="center">
        <form action="/scholar" method="get">
          <input type="text" name="q" size="30" value="funds">
&nbsp;
      <input type="text" name="as_publication" size="20" value="journal of finance">
&nbsp;
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Google Scholar Search">
        </form><br />
      </div>
            <p>  Keep in mind, however,  that publication-restricted searches may be incomplete. Google Scholar gathers bibliographical data from many sources, including automatically extracting it from text and citations. This information may be incomplete or even incorrect; many preprints, for instance, don't say where (or even whether) the article was ultimately published. 
      <p> In general, publication-restricted searches are effective if you're certain of what you're looking for, but they&lsquo;re often narrower than you might expect. </p>
      <p><b> For instance:</b><br>
  You might find that a search across all publications for [<a href="/scholar?q=mutual+funds">mutual funds</a>] gives more useful results than a more specific search for &quot;funds&quot; only in the <i>Journal of Finance</i>. </p>
      <p> Finally, bear in mind that one journal can be spelled several ways (e.g., <i>Journal of Biological Chemistry</i> is often abbreviated as <i>J Biol Chem</i>), so you may need to try several spellings of a given publication in order to get complete search results. </p>
      <h2><a name="daterestrict" id="daterestrict"></a>Date restrict</h2>
          <p> Date-restricted searches can be effective when you're looking for the latest developments in a given area. The dropdown menu labeled <em>anytime</em>, which is available on all search results pages, allows you to limit the search to commonly used recent periods. The <a href="/advanced_scholar_search">Advanced Scholar Search page</a> allows you to restrict your search to other periods.</p>
      <p><b> For example:</b><br>
  Here's how you'd search for articles on superconducting films that were published since 2004: </p>
      
      <div align="center">
        <form action="/scholar" method="get">
          <input type="text" name="q" size="30" value="superconducting films">
&nbsp;
      <input type="text" name="as_ylo" size="7" value="2004">
&nbsp;-&nbsp;
      <input type="text" name="as_yhi" size="7" value="">
&nbsp;
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Google Scholar Search">
        </form>
<br />      </div>
      
      <p> Bear in mind, however, that some web sources don't include publication dates, and a date-restricted search will not return articles for which Google Scholar was unable to determine a date of publication. So if you're sure that an article about superconducting films came out this year and a date-restricted search doesn't find it, retry the search without the date restriction.
        <p>      
      <h2><a name="legalrestrict" id="legalrestrict"></a>Legal opinions and journals</h2>
          <p>You can limit search to legal opinions and journals in several ways. From the <a href="/schhp?hl=en">Homepage</a>, you can select the option marked <em>legal opinions and journals</em>. From search results pages, you can use the first dropdown menu, which allows you to select collections to search, to make this choice. Finally, you can also select this option from the <a href="/advanced_scholar_search">Advanced Scholar Search page</a>.</p>

      <h2><a name="jurisrestrict" id="jurisrestrict"></a>Jurisdiction restrict</h2>
          <p>You can limit search to legal opinions from one or more jurisdictions. The common options for jurisdiction-restricted searches (federal cases and cases from the state you are querying from) are available via the first dropdown menu on search results pages. To specify a list of jurisdictions to search over, you can use the <a href="/advanced_scholar_search">Advanced Scholar Search page</a>.  Simply check the boxes for the jurisdictions you are interested in searching.</p>

        <h2><a name="tips" id="tips"></a>Other Operators</h2>
<p> Google Scholar also supports most of the advanced operators in Google web search: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b> the &quot;+&quot; operator</b> makes sure your results include common words, letters or numbers that Google's search technology generally ignores, as in [<a href="/scholar?q=%2Bde+knuth">+de knuth</a>]; </li>
        <li><b> the &quot;-&quot; operator</b> excludes all results that include this search term, as in [<a href="/scholar?q=flowers+%2Dauthor%3Aflowers">flowers -author:flowers</a>]; </li>
        <li><b> phrase search</b> only returns results that include this exact phrase, as in [<a href="/scholar?q=%22as+you+like+it%22">&quot;as you like it&quot;</a>]; </li>
        <li><b> the &quot;OR&quot; operator</b> returns results that include either of your search terms, as in [<a href="/scholar?q=stock+call+OR+put">stock call OR put</a>]; </li>
        <li><b> the &quot;intitle:&quot; operator</b> as in [<a href="/scholar?q=intitle%3Amars">intitle:mars</a>] only returns results that include your search term in the document's title. </li>
      </ul>
