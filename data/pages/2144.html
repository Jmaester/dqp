</table></p><p><font size="-1">Susan Foote always dreamed of seeing the world by boat. What she couldn't have
            predicted was that a sailing trip that took her from Lake Erie, Ohio to the coast of
            Opua, New Zealand would change her life and lead to a budding second career:
            book author.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> In 1998, Susan and her husband, Peter Wagner, set sail on a 41-foot classic sailing
            ketch named La Boatique. Before long they were watching a humpback whale and
            her calf swim alongside their boat, battling a rogue wave in Bermuda and witnessing
            leatherback turtles lay eggs on a secluded beach. Eager to share her experiences
            with family and friends, Foote used a single-side band radio to send email and
            began posting one or two &quot;chapters&quot; from her travels on her personal website at
            least once a month.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;I have very inquisitive friends, and they kept asking me to turn my story into a
            book,&quot; says Foote. &quot;When I realized I had thousands of people following along
            with me on my adventures, I decided to listen. I talked to some published travel
            adventure writers, and they told me a good way to break into the market would be to
            self-publish &ndash; so that's exactly what I did.&quot;
            </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Four years after setting sail, Foote returned home to embark on a new journey:
            marketing and selling her newly published book, <i>The Sailing Adventures of<br />
            La Boatique: From Lake Erie to New Zealand</i>.</font> </p>

<p><b><font size="-1">Challenge</font></b></p>
<p><font size="-1">            As a self-published author, Foote's greatest challenge is reaching her target
          audience of nautical enthusiasts with only a limited budget for marketing.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;Few people choose the cruising lifestyle, much less spend four years straight
            traveling like I did,&quot; says Foote. &quot;It takes passion for adventure, and that's a big part
            of the audience for this book &ndash; people who dream about doing it themselves.            </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;The question is, how do you make sure they find out about your book without
            spending more on advertising than you bring in from book sales?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Another challenge for Foote is time. In 2002 when the book was first published,
            she spent hours calling boating magazines, nautical clubs and local radio stations,
            newspapers and bookstores, offering to do talks, interviews and book signings.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;I worked the niche market as best I could, and in the beginning, sales were good,
            even considering my high expectations,&quot; explains Foote. &quot;But when my husband
            Pete and I began planning for a new trip, we got worried. How would the book sell
          without us there to do the footwork?&quot;</font></p>
<p> <font size="-1"><b>Solution</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">            Foote heard about free marketing via Google Books in 2005 through an email
            newsletter for self-published and freelance writers. At the time, she was no longer
            doing any specific marketing for her book beyond providing details, excerpts and
            purchasing links on her website. As a result, sales had dropped off considerably. But
          after submitting her book to Google, Foote saw a sudden increase.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;When my book appeared in Google Books, I had a wave of new orders I
            didn't expect, and started receiving email from buyers who said they found my book
            on the internet,&quot; says Foote. &quot;I hadn't been doing any other kind of marketing for
            about a year, so I knew they found me through Google.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> In addition to increased sales and exposure, Foote has gained insight into her audience.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">            &quot;I get letters from people telling me how happy they are to have found my book,
            and how it's made a big difference in their lives &ndash; very often from older women,&quot;
            explains Foote. &quot;As I point out in my book, there are many books written by men
            who convinced their loves to go cruising, but few books written by the loves who
            did it. I'm happy to know that by writing about the second chapter in my life, I'm
            inspiring other women to start their own.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>About Google Books</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Google Books enables authors
            and publishers to promote their books
            on Google. Google scans the full text of
            a partner's title so that Google users can
            see books that match the topics they are
            searching on. When users click on a book
            search result, they're taken to a Google-hosted
            web page displaying a scanned
            image of the relevant page from the book.
            Each page also contains multiple &quot;Buy this
            Book&quot; links, which enable users to purchase
            the book from online retailers. Users may
            also see contextually targeted Google
            AdWords ads on these pages. Partners
            receive a share of the revenue generated
          from ads appearing on their content. </font></p></td>
