    <h3>Requests</h3>

<ul>
    <li>See <a href="/response-types">Response Types</a> for details on specifying desired media type in a request.</li>
    <li>POST requests for writable endpoints must be <a href="/authentication">authenticated requests</a></li>
    <li>All requests must include a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43">User-Agent&nbsp;HTTP&nbsp;Header</a> (see below).
    </li><li>Requests made from Javascript running on your web pages must be <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/javascript/howto-proxy.html">proxied</a> to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same-origin&nbsp;policy</a> conflicts.</li></ul><p></p>

<a name="Responses"></a>
<h3>Responses</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All responses are <a href="utf8">UTF-8</a> encoded.</li>
    <li>Times are expressed in Unix epoch format.</li>
    <li>List responses with zero elements include an empty container element and an HTTP response code of 200.</li>

    <li>Responses to requests for a single element, when the element does not exist, return an error element and an HTTP response code of 404.</li>
    <li>See <a href="/documentation/errors">API Errors</a> for description of status codes and error behavior.</li>
</ul><p></p>

<a name="ResponsesMayAdjustRequestedTimePeriods"></a>
<h3>Responses May Adjust Requested Time Periods</h3>
<p>You'll notice that some responses contain data for slightly different time periods than those you requested with arguments like <em>min_date</em>, <em>max_date</em>, and so on.  That's because the API adjusts your arguments in order to respond quickly.</p>

<p>You can still get exactly the data you need, but you may have to make additional requests.  Each response includes the adjusted timestamps in the <em>min_date</em> and <em>max_date</em> properties of the root element.  Your application must pay attention to the adjusted timestamps and, if necessary, make an additional request for adjacent time periods.  Your application also must examine each element in the response and ignore those that fall outside the precise time period required.</p>
<p>Or you may find it easier to design your application to be flexible about the time periods.</p>
<p>In the response, the <em>min_date</em> property is always present.  The <em>max_date</em> property is present only when the request included a maximum timestamp argument, such as <em>max_date</em>, <em>max_submit_date</em>, or <em>max_promote_date</em>.</p>

<a name="ImplicitTimePeriods"></a>
<h3>Implicit Time Periods</h3>
<p>Many requests allow you to specify arguments like <em>min_date</em> and <em>max_date</em>, but even if you do not include these arguments in your request, many API requests imply a time period, to ensure a quick response</p>
<p>For example, this request seems to ask for every Digg by every Digg user, ever (Well, back to 2004, anyway.):</p>
<p>
    </p><pre class="verbatim">http://services.digg.com/1.0/endpoint?method=digg.getAll</pre>

<p>(That's an example of the <a href="/api/docs/1.0/groups#digg">digg</a> group of methods.)</p>
<p>We'd like to give you that information, but, as you can imagine, it would take some time to compile a response that includes millions of Diggs.  (Sure, you'll only get up to 100 of them at a time, but we still need to figure out how many there are!)</p>
<p>In order to respond quickly, the API applies an implicit time period.  For the <a href="/api/docs/1.0/groups#digg">digg</a> methods, the implicit time period is currently "the last hour."  This may change from time to time, so your application should look to the <em>min_date</em> and/or <em>max_date</em> properties of the root element of the response for the time period applied.

</p>
<p>To learn which requests use an implicit time period, see the documentation for each endpoint.  Often, an implicit time period is <em>not</em> used, when the request is limited to, for example, a single user or a single story.  The API always indicates whether an implicit time period was applied, by including the <em>min_date</em> and/or <em>max_date</em> properties in the root element of the response.</p>

<a name="MultipleRequeststoCollectContinuousData"></a>
<h3>Multiple Requests to Collect Continuous Data</h3>
<p>Since the API may adjust the requested time period and apply implicit time periods to requests, how can an application collect continuous data?  By making successive requests for adjacent time periods.</p>

<p>Imagine an application that needs to collect data from the latest to the earliest.  That application should:</p>
<ol><li>Make an initial request with no <em>min_date</em> or <em>max_date</em> argument.  The response will include only the latest items.  The start of the implicit time period can be found in the <em>min_date</em> property of the root element of the response.</li><li>Note the <em>min_date</em> property in the response, and make another request with that timestamp as the <em>max_date</em> argument.  The response will include items which immediately precede that timestamp, and a new value in the <em>min_date</em> property.</li><li>Repeat step 2 until the requests have gone back in time far enough to retrieve all of the data needed.</li></ol>

<p>Note: It may be necessary to use the offset and count arguments to retrieve all of the data for each time period.  See <a href="#UsingOffsets">Using Offsets</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Now consider an application that keeps track of current data in real time.  That application should:</p>
<ol><li>Make an initial request with no <em>min_date</em> or <em>max_date</em> argument.  The response will include only the latest items.  The end of the implicit time period can be found in the <em>timestamp</em> property of the root element of the response--it'll be close to the time when the request was received.</li><li>Note the <em>timestamp</em> in the response, and make another request with that timestamp as the <em>min_date</em> argument.  The response will include items which immediately follow that timestamp, and a new value in the <em>timestamp</em> property.</li><li>Repeat step 2 to get even more current data.</li></ol>

<p>But remember, <a href="#BePolitePlease">be polite</a>: Don't make requests every second, or our operations guys may see your application as an attacking robot.  Consider making one request per minute, and processing or displaying the data between requests.  That's how Stamen's flash toolkit does its magic.</p>

<a name="UsingOffsets"></a>
<h3>Using Offsets</h3>
<p>The <em>offset</em> and <em>count</em> arguments are used to ensure that each response is of a reasonable size. When a request specifies a large amount of data, such as many Diggs, users, or news items, each response provides only a portion of that data.  Additional requests can retrieve, piece by piece, the desired result, by specifying an <em>offset</em> into the data and a <em>count</em> of elements to be returned.  The maximum count for each request is limited.  See the documentation of each endpoint for the specific limit.</p>

<p>Retrieving the full set of data in this way can require a fairly complex string of asynchronous requests, so provided below is example code to bootstrap common tasks.</p>
<p>Note: Example code generally assumes that you're using <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">Prototype</a>. You should be familiar with it before proceeding any further.</p>

<a name="UserAgents"></a>
<h3>User Agents</h3>
<p>All API requests must include a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.43">User-Agent&nbsp;HTTP&nbsp;Header</a>.  A request without this header will receive no response.
</p><p>Some commonly used languages do not send the User-Agent header by default.
</p><p>In PHP, for example, one must explicitly set the user_agent setting in php.ini or through ini_set().  Example:</p><pre class="verbatim">ini_set('user_agent', 'My-Application/2.5');</pre>

<p>In Ruby, the User-Agent header can be explicitly included:</p><pre class="verbatim">open('http://services.digg.com/1.0/endpoint?method=user.getInfo&amp;username=shupp', 'User-Agent' =&gt; 'My-Application/2.5')</pre>
<p>(Thanks, <a href="http://www.poweredbygeek.com/">Lynn</a>.)
</p><p>We welcome contributions of other examples.</p>

<a name="BePolitePlease"></a>
<h3>Be Polite, Please!</h3>
<p>Use good judgment when designing your application. Don't make repeated requests for the same data frequently. Examples:</p>

<ul><li>If you call the API to find out whether a story has been submitted, wait a minute or two between requests.</li><li>To track diggs as they occur, call the API once a minute to retrieve the diggs during the last minute. The response includes a "max_date" timestamp that you can use as the "min_date" argument for your next call.</li><li>If your application doesn't need real-time data, cache the API responses on your server or use a cached proxy. (More on caching below.) </li></ul>
<p>We monitor API usage, and we may block applications that do silly things. Use good judgment to keep your application running smoothly! If you want to see statistics on your application's usage, you can check the 3 X-RateLimit headers included in API responses:

</p><ul>
    <li>X-RateLimit-Current (current number of requests during this time period)</li>
    <li>X-RateLimit-Max (the max number of requests allowed during the current period)</li>
    <li>X-RateLimit-Reset (time in seconds until the current period ends, and your usage is reset)</li>
</ul><p></p>


<a name="CachingAPIResponses"></a>
<h3>Caching API Responses</h3>
<p>Most applications don't need real-time API responses and so should use caching to avoid getting blocked. This is especially true if you have a high-traffic web site and you want to display Digg data directly on your web pages. All web sites, regardless of traffic, should use one of these methods to cache API responses:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Make the API request in your server-side code and cache the response.
    </li><li>Set up a cached proxy on your web site. If your web page calls the Digg API via AJAX, you'll need a proxy in any case, due to Javascript security, and it's straightforward to add a cache to your proxy.
</li>
