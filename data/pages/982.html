    <p class="first"><strong>Welcome to Google!</strong></p>
    <P>By using Google Translator Toolkit
      (the “Service”), you agree to be bound by our Google Terms of
      Services located at
      <A href="http://www.google.com/accounts/TOS" target="_blank"><U>http://www.google.com/<WBR>accounts/TOS</U></A>
      as well as these additional terms. Google may change these terms from time to
      time and post any modified terms at
      <A href="http://translate.google.com/toolkit/TOS.html" target="_blank"><U>http://translate.google.com/<WBR>toolkit/TOS.html</U></A>.
      You understand and agree that if you use the Service after the date on which
      these terms have changed, Google will treat your use as acceptance of the
      updated terms.</P>
    <P><B>Use of your Content</B></P>
    <P>By submitting your content through the
      Service, you grant Google the permission to use your content permanently to
      promote, improve or offer the Services. When, in the course of using your
      content to promote, improve or offer the Services, Google displays the content
      to an end user, it will do so only according to the sharing rules below, and
      only on a translation unit basis.&nbsp; The
      term “translation unit” has the meaning assigned to it in the
      XLIFF standard, and “displaying on a translation unit basis” means
      that a translated segment will be displayed only in response to fuzzy
      match search of the source segment. </P>
    <B>Sharing your Documents, Glossaries and Translation Memory(-ies) with
      others and terminating your Google account</B></P>
  <P><I>Documents </I>
    &nbsp;<BR>
    Each document is only viewable by you and users with whom you explicitly
    share the document.</P>
  <P><I>Glossaries</I>&nbsp;<BR>
    Each glossary is only viewable by you and users with whom you explicitly
    share the glossary.</P>
  <P><I>Translation
      Memories</I>&nbsp;<BR>
    (1) If you mark your translation memory as "not shared with everyone",
    each translation unit in the translation memory will be viewable only
    by you and users with whom you explicitly share the translation memory
    or documents that use the translation memory. </P>
  <P>(2)&nbsp; If you mark your
    translation memory as "shared with everyone", each translation
    unit in the translation memory will be viewable by other end users.</P>
  <P>(3) Note that regardless of
    whether or not a translation memory is "shared with everyone"
    or "not shared with everyone", when you create a translation
    memory entry, your content is subject to the “Use of your Content”
    section above.</P>
  <P>You can revoke sharing privileges
    on Documents, Glossaries, or Translation Memories that you created at
    any time. If you do not want your Translation Documents, Glossaries,
    or Translation Memory(-ies) to continue to be shared with the people
    you designated for sharing after you terminate your Google account,
    you must revoke sharing privileges prior to terminating your Google
    account. &nbsp;<BR></P>
