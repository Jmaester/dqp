<p><span class=si><b>What is Google Scholar?</b></span> <br>
             Google Scholar provides a simple way to broadly search for scholarly literature. From one place, you can search across many disciplines and sources: articles, theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites. Google Scholar helps you find relevant work across the world of scholarly research.</p>
        <p><span class=si><b> Features of Google Scholar</b></span>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Search</b> diverse sources from one convenient place </li>
          <li><b>Find</b> articles, theses, books, abstracts or court opinions </li>
          <li><b>Locate</b> the complete document through your library or on the web </li>
          <li><b>Learn</b> about key scholarly literature in any area of research </li>
      </ul>
        <p><span class=si><b>How are documents ranked?</b></span><br>
        Google Scholar aims to rank documents the way  researchers do, weighing the full text of each document, where it was published, who it was written by, as well as how often and how recently it has been cited in other  scholarly literature.</p>
        <b class=si>A note from the Google Scholar team</b> <br>
         We recognize the debt we owe to scholars everywhere whose work has made Google itself a reality and we hope to make Google Scholar as useful to this community as possible. We believe everyone should have a chance to stand on the shoulders of giants.<br>
