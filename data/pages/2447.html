<p><font size="-1"><b>About the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)
      </b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">        Established in 1959, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has a longstanding
        tradition of implementing novel tools and approaches to supporting
        development. The IDB is the primary source of multilateral financing for economic,
        social and institutional development in Latin America and the Caribbean. In
        addition to its lending operations, the IDB fosters sustainable growth through its
        leadership in regional initiatives, strategic research and knowledge dissemination.
        The Bank publishes an average of 30 books and 100 working papers per year in<br />
        four languages: English, Spanish, French and Portuguese.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> <b>Challenge</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">        As the leading regional development bank in Latin America and the Caribbean,
        the IDB's primary challenge is increasing awareness of its products, services and
        publications. The IDB is an extraordinary resource for information on Latin America
        and the Caribbean.
        &quot;Our mission is to reach the largest possible audience with information about what
        we do and why we publish,&quot; explains Grace Guinand of the IDB's editorial unit.
        As part of this effort, the IDB publishes its books and working papers in English,
        Spanish, French and Portuguese, and has begun to explore new ways to reach its
        readership of government policymakers, NGOs, business analysts and academic
        researchers from all over the world..</font></p>

<font color="#3366CC" size="-1">"At first, we didn't understand why all of a sudden we were
                getting a request for this older title. But when we looked at the
                reports from Google, we saw that it was one of the most-viewed titles
                over the past 15 days...Best of all, this book is not an exception.
                Our e-commerce sales have increased 60% across the board."</font>
<hr size="1" noshade color="C9D7F1" /></td>

<p><font size="-1">A second challenge for the IDB is increasing sales. &quot;First and foremost, we want
        more people to know about our organization and services,&quot; says Guinand. &quot;But we
        also want to sell more books, and the diversity of our audience makes marketing
      especially challenging.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Solution</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">In an internal editorial meeting to discuss content aggregation, IDB staff members
        heard about Google Books and decided to join the program to gain online
        exposure and open a new marketing channel for its publications.
        &quot;If you're not in Google, you're nowhere,&quot; explains Guinand. &quot;We decided to use
        Google because it's the best way to reach the largest audience. It doesn't cost you a
      thing, but you get such big rewards.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">So far, the IDB has submitted more than a hundred titles to the program. The
        results have surpassed its expectations and brought welcome surprises. For
        instance, in April of 2006, the IDB's distributor in Mexico received a request for
      600 copies of a Spanish title the organization published in 1999.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;At first, we didn't understand why all of a sudden we were getting a request for
        this older title,&quot; says Guinand. &quot;But when we looked at the reports from Google, we
        saw that it was one of the most-viewed titles over the past 15 days. It came as such
        a surprise that two months later, we were still working to fill that order. Best of all,
        this book is not an exception. Our e-commerce sales have increased 60% across
        the board.&quot;        </font></p>

<p><font size="-1">Another surprise for the IDB has been the demand for books in Spanish. &quot;We
        didn't know what to expect, so in the beginning we sent titles in English and only
        a few books in Spanish. But when we saw that more people were viewing pages
        in Spanish, we started moving in more Spanish titles &ndash; even older ones from our
        backlist,&quot; reports Guinand.<br />
        In addition to allowing the IDB to identify which titles readers are most interested
        in, reports from Google Books provide the organization with valuable
        information and motivation for the authors on its research staff.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;The great thing about Google is that you get information about who is reading
        which titles right away. We're addicted; we check our reports twice a day, and we
        share those figures with our authors,&quot; says Guinand. &quot;On the web, you never know
        what you'll get. One day we received a huge number of page views in Google Book
        Search &ndash; more than twice the average. When we tell our authors, 'you got this
        number of page views this week,' they're excited and encouraged.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Since joining Google Books, the IDB has decided to make a higher
        percentage of its books viewable online: 60 percent, as opposed to the default
        20 percent. It has also begun submitting its white papers for inclusion in Google
        Scholar. The reason: the IDB believes that by giving readers greater access to its
        content, it will help them become familiar with the organization and increase the
        likelihood that they will purchase books.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> &quot;This is the first stage,&quot; says Guinand. &quot;Once our readers know they can find us on
        Google and discover the richness of information we have to offer, they'll want more.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>About Google Books</b>
</font>
</p><p><font size="-1">Google Books enables authors
        and publishers to promote their books
        on Google. Google scans the full text of a
        partner's titles so that Google users can
        see books that match the topics they are
        searching on. When users click on a book
        search result, they're taken to a Googlehosted
        web page displaying a scanned
        image of the relevant page from the book.
        Each page also contains multiple &quot;Buy this
        Book&quot; links, which enable users to purchase
        the book from online retailers. Users may
        also see contextually targeted Google
        AdWords ads on these pages. Partners
        receive a share of the revenue generated
      from ads appearing on their content.</font></p></td>
