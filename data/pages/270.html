          <h1>Inclusion Guidelines for Webmasters</h1>
          <div class="content">

<p>This document describes the technical details of indexing of websites with scholarly articles in Google Scholar. Its intended audience is webmasters who would like their papers included in Google Scholar search results. See <a href="publishers.html">this page</a> for a less technical overview of the indexing process.</p>

<p><b>If you're an individual author,</b> it works best to simply upload your paper to your website, e.g., <tt>www.example.edu/~professor/jpdr2009.pdf</tt>; and add a link to it on your publications page, such as <tt>www.example.edu/~professor/publications.html</tt>. Make sure that (a) the full text of your paper is in a PDF file that ends with ".pdf", (b) the title of the paper appears in a large font on top of the first page, (c) the authors of the paper are listed right below the title on a line by itself, and (d) there's a bibliography section titled, e.g., "References" or "Bibliography" at the end. That's it! Our search robots should normally find your paper and include it in Google Scholar within several weeks. If it <i>doesn't</i> work, you could either (1) read more detailed technical guidelines below or (2) check if your local institutional repository is already configured for indexing in Google Scholar, and upload your papers there.</p>

<h2>Content Guidelines</h2>

<ol>

<li>The content hosted on your website must consist primarily of scholarly articles - journal papers, conference papers, technical reports, or their drafts, dissertations, pre-prints, post-prints, or abstracts. Content such as news or magazine articles, book reviews, and editorials is not appropriate for Google Scholar. Documents larger than 5MB, such as books and long dissertations, should be uploaded to Google Book Search; Google Scholar automatically includes scholarly works from Google Book Search.</li>

<li>Users click through to your website to read your articles. To be included, your website <b>must</b> make either the full text of the articles or their complete author-written abstracts freely available and easy to see when users click on your URLs in Google search results. Your site <b>must not</b> require users (or search robots) to sign in, install special software, accept disclaimers, dismiss popup or interstitial advertisements, click on links or buttons, or scroll down the page before they can read the entire abstract of the paper. Sites that show login pages, error pages, or bare bibliographic data without abstracts will not be considered for inclusion and may be removed from Google Scholar.</li>

</ol>

<br>

<h2>Crawl Guidelines</h2>

<p>Google Scholar uses automated software, known as "robots" or "crawlers", to fetch your files for inclusion in the search results. It operates similarly to regular Google search. Your website needs to be structured in a way that makes it possible to "crawl" it in this manner. In particular:</p>

<ol>

<li>Your articles need to be either in the HTML or in the PDF file format. PDF files must have searchable text, i.e., you must be able to search for and find words in the document using Adobe Acrobat Reader. Each file must not exceed 5MB in size. To index larger files, or to index scanned images of pages that require OCR, please upload them to Google Book Search.</li>

<li>If you're hosting a small collection of publications, such as papers written by a single author or a small group, then we recommend that you list them on a single HTML page, such as <tt>www.example.edu/~professor/publications.html</tt>, and include links to their full text in the PDF format. This arrangement of files will make it easy for the search robots to find all of your papers.</li>

<li>If you're hosting a larger collection of papers, such as a university-wide repository, then it would not be practical to list all of the articles on a single webpage. In this case, all the papers must be discoverable from the homepage of your collection by following <b>at most ten</b> simple HTML links. The use of Flash, JavaScript, or form-based navigation makes it hard for our automated system to find your articles. If your site uses these types of navigation, please add a "browse by date" interface that uses simple HTML links, as described below.</li>

<li>If your website has thousands of papers or more, the best way to make sure they're all discovered by the search robots is to provide a way to list them by the date of publication or the date of record entry. Other forms of browse interfaces, such as browse by author or by keyword, often generate more browse URLs than the website can actually provide to the search robots. To ensure that the robots can find all of your articles, we recommend that the total number of intermediate "browse" URLs does not exceed 10% of the number of article URLs. We also recommend that the browse interface require no more than ten clicks from the starting point of the collection to reach any given paper.</li>

<li>For larger websites, we recommend that you create an additional browse interface that lists only the articles added in the last two weeks. This smaller set of pages can be recrawled more frequently than your entire browse interface, which will facilitate timely coverage of your recent papers by the search robots. New additions can be listed in either the HTML or the RSS file format.</li>

<li>Since Google refers users to your website to read the papers, your webpages must be available to both users and crawlers at all times. The search robots will visit your webpages periodically in order to pick up the updates, as well as to ensure that your URLs are still available. If search robots are unable to fetch your webpages, e.g., due to server errors, misconfiguration, or an overly slow response from your website, some or all of your articles could drop out of Google and Google Scholar. Use HTTP 5xx codes to indicate temporary errors that should be retried soon, such as temporary shortage of backend capacity. Use HTTP 4xx codes to indicate permanent errors that should not be retried for some time, such as inability to find the file in question. If you need to move your articles to new URLs, set up HTTP 301 redirects from the old location of each article to the new one.</li>

<li>If your website uses a <tt>robots.txt</tt> file, e.g., <tt>www.example.com/robots.txt</tt>, it <b>must not</b> block Google's search robots from accessing your articles or your browse URLs. Conversely, it should block robots from accessing large dynamically generated spaces that aren't useful in the discovery of your articles, such as shopping carts, comment forms, or results of your own keyword search. E.g., to let Google's robots access all URLs on your site, add the following section to you <tt>robots.txt</tt>:
<br><br>
<pre>
User-agent: Googlebot
Allow: /
</pre>
Or, to block all robots from adding books to your shopping cart, add the following:
<br><br>
<pre>
User-agent: *
Disallow: /add_cart.php
</pre>
<br>
Please refer to <tt>http://www.robotstxt.org/</tt> for more information about <tt>robots.txt</tt> files.
</li>

</ol>

<br>

<h2>Indexing Guidelines</h2>

<p>Google Scholar uses automated software, known as "parsers", to identify bibliographic data of your papers, as well as references between the papers. Incorrect identification of bibliographic data or references will lead to poor indexing of your site. Some documents may not be included at all, some may be included with incorrect author names or titles, and some may rank lower in the search results, because their (incorrect) bibliographic data would not match (correct) references to them from other papers. To avoid such problems, you need to provide bibliographic data and references in a way that automated "parser" software can process.</p>

<ol>

<li>If you're using repository or journal management software, such as Eprints, DSpace, Digital Commons or OJS, please configure it to export bibliographic data in HTML "<tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt>" tags. Google Scholar supports Highwire Press tags (e.g., <tt>citation_title</tt>), Eprints tags (e.g., <tt>eprints.title</tt>), BE Press tags (e.g., <tt>bepress_citation_title</tt>), and PRISM tags (e.g., <tt>prism.title</tt>). Use Dublin Core tags (e.g., <tt>DC.title</tt>) as a last resort - they work poorly for journal papers because Dublin Core doesn't have unambiguous fields for journal title, volume, issue, and page numbers.  To check that these tags are present, visit several abstracts and view their HTML source.<p>

<ol type="A">

<li>The title tag, e.g., <tt>citation_title</tt> or <tt>DC.title</tt>, must contain the title of the paper. Don't use it for the title of the journal or a book in which the paper was published, or for the name of your repository. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</li>

<li>The author tag, e.g., <tt>citation_author</tt> or <tt>DC.creator</tt>, must contain the authors (and only the actual authors) of the paper. Don't use it for the author of the website or for contributors other than authors, e.g., thesis advisors. Author names can be listed either as "Smith, John" or as "John Smith". Put each author name in a separate tag and omit all affiliations, degrees, certifications, etc. from this field. At least one author tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</li>

<li>The date tag, e.g., <tt>citation_date</tt> or <tt>DC.issued</tt>, must contain the date of publication, i.e., the date that would normally be cited in references to this paper from other papers. Don't use it for the date of entry into the repository - that should go into <tt>citation_online_date</tt> instead. Provide full dates in the "2010/5/12" format if available; or a year alone otherwise. This tag is required for inclusion in Google Scholar.</li>

<li>For journal and conference papers, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: <tt>citation_journal_title</tt> or <tt>citation_conference_title</tt>, <tt>citation_issn</tt>, <tt>citation_isbn</tt>, <tt>citation_volume</tt>, <tt>citation_issue</tt>, <tt>citation_firstpage</tt>, and <tt>citation_lastpage</tt>. Dublin Core equivalents are <tt>DC.relation.ispartof</tt> for journal and conference titles and the non-standard tags <tt>DC.citation.volume</tt>, <tt>DC.citation.issue</tt>, <tt>DC.citation.spage</tt> (start page), and <tt>DC.citation.epage</tt> (end page) for the remaining fields. Regardless of the scheme chosen, these fields must contain sufficient information to identify a reference to this paper from another document, which is normally all of: (a) journal or conference name, (b) volume and issue numbers, if applicable, and (c) the number of the first page of the paper in the volume (or issue) in question.</li>

<li>For theses, dissertations, and technical reports, provide the remaining bibliographic citation data in the following tags: <tt>citation_dissertation_institution</tt>, <tt>citation_technical_report_institution</tt> or <tt>DC.publisher</tt> for the name of the institution and <tt>citation_technical_report_number</tt> for the number of the technical report. As with journal and conference papers, you need to provide sufficient information to recognize a formal citation to this document from another article.</li>

<li>If the value for a tag includes quotes (e.g., <em>"Walk in my shoes" - a critical analysis</em>), you must ecape the quotes (e.g., <em>&amp;quot;Walk in my shoes&amp;quot; - a critical analysis</em>). </li>

<li>The "<tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt>" tags normally apply only to the exact page on which they're provided. If this page shows only the abstract of the paper and you have the full text in a separate file, e.g., in the PDF format, please specify the locations of all full text versions using <tt>citation_pdf_url</tt> or <tt>DC.identifier</tt> tags. The content of the tag is the absolute URL of the PDF file; for security reasons, it must refer to a file in the same subdirectory as the HTML abstract. Failure to link the alternate versions together could result in the incorrect indexing of the PDF files, because these files would be processed as separate documents without the information contained in the meta tags.</li>

</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre style="border:1px solid gray">
&lt;meta name="citation_title" content="The testis isoform of the phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit (PhK-T) plays a critical role in regulation of glycogen mobilization in developing lung"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_author" content="Liu, Li"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_author" content="Rannels, Stephen R."&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_author" content="Falconieri, Mary"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_author" content="Phillips, Karen S."&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_author" content="Wolpert, Ellen B."&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_author" content="Weaver, Timothy E."&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_date" content="1996/05/17"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_journal_title" content="Journal of Biological Chemistry"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_volume" content="271"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_issue" content="20"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_firstpage" content="11761"&gt;
&lt;meta name="citation_pdf_url" content="http://www.example.com/content/271/20/11761.full.pdf"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Keep in mind that, regardless of the meta-tag scheme chosen, you need to provide at least three fields: (1) the title of the article, (2) the full name of at least the first author, and (3) the year of publication. Pages that don't provide any one of these three fields will be processed as if they had no meta tags at all. Likewise, webpages that don't contain the metatags themselves and aren't linked from other pages that do contain the meta tags using <tt>citation_pdf_url</tt> or <tt>DC.identifier</tt>, including both HTML and PDF files, will also be processed as independent documents without the meta tags.</p>
</li>

<li>If it's not practical for you to implement the HTML "<tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt>" tags, e.g., if your papers are only available in the PDF format, then the document needs to be visually laid out according to the following conventions.<p>

<ol type="A">

<li>The title of the paper must be the largest chunk of text on top of the page. Either use font size of at least 24 pt. in PDF, or place the title inside an "<tt>&lt;h1&gt;</tt>" or an "<tt>&lt;h2&gt;</tt>" tag in HTML, or use a CSS class named "<tt>citation_title</tt>". Make sure that all other text on the page, in particular the name of the repository or the journal, is set in a smaller font than the title of the paper - otherwise, this other, larger, text may be incorrectly interpreted as the title of the paper.</li>

<li>The authors of the paper must be listed right before or right after the title, in a slightly smaller font that is still larger than normal text. Either use a 16-23 pt. font in PDF, or place the authors inside an "<tt>&lt;h3&gt;</tt>" tag in HTML, or wrap them in a CSS class named "<tt>citation_author</tt>". Make sure the names of the repository and the journal, as well as the text of the section headings, are set in a smaller font than the authors of the paper - otherwise, this other, larger, text may be incorrectly interpreted as the authors. Use "Sentence case" as opposed to "Title Case" for section headings et. al., to avoid confusion with author names. Separate multiple author names with commas or semicolons and omit their affiliations, degrees, and certifications from the author line. Use an explicit format such as "by John Smith" or "Author: John Smith", if appropriate.</li>

<li>Include a bibliographic citation to a published version of the paper on a line by itself, and place it inside the header or the footer of the first page in the PDF file, or next to the title and the authors in HTML. Use an explicit citation format, e.g.: "J. Biol. Chem., vol. 234, no. 8, pp. 1971-1975, August 1959". If the paper is unpublished, include the full date of its present version on a line by itself, e.g., "August 12, 2009".</li>

<li>Avoid use of Type&nbsp;3 fonts in PDF files, because they're often generated with missing or incorrect font size and character encoding information, which makes it difficult for our parser software to extract the bibliographic data. You can check the types of the fonts under the <em>File&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Properties...</em> menu in Adobe Acrobat Reader. If you're using LaTeX, consider switching to Type&nbsp;1 fonts, e.g., <tt>\usepackage{times}</tt>, <tt>\usepackage{helvet}</tt>, or <tt>\usepackage{palatino}</tt>.</li>

</ol>

<p>Please understand that it's not possible for our automated parsers to correctly identify bibliographic data in such free-form formats with 100% accuracy; and that failure to correctly identify certain fields can lead to exclusion of your papers from Google Scholar. If you're not satisfied with the accuracy of your Google Scholar results, you need to create HTML pages with abstracts and add "<tt>&lt;meta&gt;</tt>" tags to them, as described above.</p>

</li>

<li>Place each article and each abstract in a separate HTML or PDF file. At this time, we're unable to effectively index multiple abstracts on the same page or multiple papers in the same PDF file. Likewise, we're unable to index different sections of the same paper in different files. Each paper must be in its own unique file in order for it to be included in Google Scholar.</li>

<li>Mark the section of the paper that contains references to other works with a standard heading, such as "References" or "Bibliography", on a line just by itself. Individual references inside this section should be either numbered "1. - 2. - 3." or "[1] - [2] - [3]" in PDF, or put inside an "<tt>&lt;ol&gt;</tt>" list in HTML. The text of each reference must be a formal bibliographic citation in a commonly used format, without free-form commentary.<p>
<p>Please understand that the references are identified automatically by the parser software; they're not entered or corrected by human operators. While we try to support most common reference formats, it is not possible to guarantee that all references are identified correctly; and incorrect identification of references could lead to exclusion of your papers from Google Scholar or to low ranking of your papers in the search results.</p>
</li>

</ol>

<br>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>To check if a particular paper is included in Google Scholar, search Google Scholar for its title. To check the coverage of your website in Google Scholar, search for titles of several dozen papers and see if these papers are included. If you can't find many of the papers in Google Scholar, there's probably a problem with the indexing of your website; please read the troubleshooting tips below.</p>

<ol>

<li>Keep in mind that changes that you make on your website will usually not be reflected in Google Scholar search results for some time. New papers are normally added several times a week; however, updates of papers that are already included usually take 3-6 months. Updates of papers on very large websites may take several years, because to update a site, we need to recrawl it - the time it takes to recrawl a large site is usually limited by the speed at which the target website is able to deliver content to the search robots.</li>

<li>Keep in mind that the result count of the "site:" operator is not a good indicator of coverage of your website in Google Scholar. First, this operator currently only searches primary versions of the papers. If you're not the primary publisher, some of the papers that you host may not be counted. Second, the result count is usually estimated based on searching a small fraction of the index (the purpose of the result count is to help users refine their queries and not coverage checking). As a result, this estimate may not be accurate. If you're alarmed that the result count for your site is low, please confirm the problem with a more detailed check. We recommend trying to find several dozen of sample papers using search by title.</li>

<li>Check that your webpages follow the content guidelines above. Only scholarly papers are appropriate for inclusion in Google Scholar; each paper needs to be listed on a separate URL; and at least the full author-written abstract must be clearly visible on the URL that you wish to be included in Google Scholar search results. Failure to follow these guidelines could lead to exclusion of your content from Google Scholar.</li>

<li>Provided that the content guidelines are met, the most common cause of indexing problems is incorrect extraction of bibliographic data by the automated parser software. To diagnose such issues, find a sample of included papers by searching Google Scholar for [<tt>site:example.com</tt>], go to page ten or later of the search results, and check if the titles and the authors of your papers are listed correctly. If you see very few results, and if their listed titles or authors are mostly incorrect, then this is, indeed, a parsing problem. E.g., if the name of your journal or repository is erroneously listed as the title of your papers, then there's a good chance that many of your papers aren't included at all, because documents with the same title are often considered duplicates. <p>
<blockquote>The best way to fix incorrect bibliographic data is to provide it in a computer-readable form in meta tags, as described in the indexing guidelines above. Keep in mind that, since these papers are already included in Google Scholar, updating their bibliographic data will usually take 3-6 months from the time you provide it on your website.</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If the bibliographic data listed in Google Scholar is mostly correct, but you still can't find many of your papers there, then it could be a problem with the crawl. Check that your website allows indexing by Google search robots. Can you click through from the homepage to the articles using only simple HTML links? Does your <tt>robots.txt</tt> file block the articles or the browse pages from being crawled? Is your website unusually slow in responding to crawlers? Does it limit the crawl speed or frequently return errors to the search robots? Does it have a lot of navigation, search, shopping and other URLs that aren't papers and don't help with discovering papers? Any of these issues can lead to slow updates of your content or to removal of your papers from Google Scholar. <p>
<blockquote>Please check the crawl guidelines above regarding the technical requirements and the possible solutions. Once you update your website, it can take anywhere from a few days to 3-6 months for these changes to be reflected in Google Scholar search results.</blockquote>
</li>

<li>If you've met all content, crawl, and indexing guidelines, but your papers still aren't indexed correctly after six months, then it's possible that the search robots aren't aware of your website. To rectify this, you can request manual configuration of your website <a href="http://www.google.com/support/scholar/bin/request.py">here</a>. The reviewers can configure the crawlers to better identify the URLs of the browse interface and the articles on your website. However, they aren't able to enter or correct bibliographic data for you; and they cannot assist you if your website doesn't follow the guidelines in this document.</li>

</ol>

<p>While we hope that the text of your papers has a substantial element of novelty and interest, we recommend that, when it comes to their indexing, you boldly go where others have gone before. Conventional formatting of documents and their bibliograpic data, as well as the use of common journal and repository management software, go a long way towards ensuring that your papers are all covered and ranked appropriately in Google Scholar.</p>
