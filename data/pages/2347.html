<p><font size="-1">Cambridge University Press was founded by a royal charter granted to the University of
Cambridge by King Henry VIII in 1534. It is the oldest printer and publisher in the world,
having been operating continuously since 1584, and is one of the largest academic and
professional publishers globally.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The Press’s purpose is to further the University’s objective of advancing learning,
knowledge and research, and it publishes over 1,200 new titles per year for academic
and professional markets with over 24,000 books in print. With offices in 30 countries,
Cambridge University Press has evolved to become a truly global publisher in the modern
age. Despite its high title output, all books are required to undergo a process of rigorous
scholarly review and the approval of the Press Syndicate - a governing body of University
academics - before being published.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Cambridge University Press combines tradition and a history of excellence with an
innovative approach to publishing, embracing digital and online advances in the field.
An ultra-short run printing programme ensures that as many books are kept in print as
possible, and Cambridge University Press has developed a strong online presence to drive
increased sales.

<p><font size="-1">The high quality of Cambridge University Press books is extremely important to the
organisation, and allowing consumers anywhere to view titles throughout the list is
essential for continuing sales. &quot;Visibility is critical for our books, because they tend to be
specialised and targeted at niche markets,&quot; explains Pete Shemilt, Sales and Marketing
Director in Europe for the Academic and Professional Books group. &quot;Our marketing
challenge is to find ways to reach the widest possible audience for each book cost effectively,
motivating purchase or recommendation. The key thing for us is to make the
public aware of all of our books: not just the frontlist, but the backlist too.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>Solution</b></font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Allowing the discovery of titles which leads to sales was therefore the key reason
behind Cambridge’s decision to join Google Books. The Press first heard about
the programme in April 2004 at the London Book Fair, and within a month committed
almost all of its backlist. &quot;We want all our books to be made instantly available for
purchase to anybody searching for them, and what better way of doing it than through
Google,&quot; says Pete Shemilt. &quot;Google listened to everything we said and has been a
very good partner. After all, this is a real partnership, one where we know scholarly and
professional publishing and Google knows how to connect information and people.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;Since joining Google Books, our backlist sales have increased across all channels,
due to many positive factors&quot; says Shemilt. To explore the effect of Google Books
specifically, Cambridge University Press studied the differences between 2003 sales and
2006 sales for books that were published before the year 2000. They discovered that
in the United States, books in the Google Books programme had a sales rate 20
percentage points higher than those that were not in the programme.
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;The market for older books is clearly becoming stronger,&quot; explains Shemilt. &quot;Content
can be kept in front of people for much longer on the web. It is giving us the opportunity
to make high quality products, once difficult to find, more visible to the consumer. This
is of considerable benefit to our authors.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Cambridge University Press is determined to pursue any channel which increases the
visibility of its books while ensuring they remain secure, and the Internet has proved a
valuable tool for this. &quot;If there are millions of people looking on your website for books,
how can it not be driving sales?

<font color="#3366cc" size="-1">&quot;We’re absolutely certain that Google Books is making a
difference to sales of the backlist... It’s the publishing equivalent
of being able to walk around a car, look under the bonnet and kick
the tyres before making the decision to purchase&quot;

<p><font size="-1">&quot;There were security concerns, of course, but we talked to Google and they put our
minds at rest. Even so, we do occasionally spend time trying to break into Google’s
system,&quot; confesses Shemilt, &quot;but the viewing limits always work exactly as they are
supposed to.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Cambridge University Press measures its own website traffic through Google Analytics.
The marketing team has found that Google Web Search and Book Search cumulatively
account for over 65% of all traffic to its website. Although the majority of visitors come
from the main Google Search pages, a Book Search visitor is actually more valuable
than the average visitor to the Cambridge University Press website. A user who comes
from Google Books typically looks at more pages on the site, is twice as likely to
purchase a book, and spends 50% more per order, when compared to other visitors.
&quot;We’re absolutely certain that Google Books is making a difference to sales of the
backlist,&quot; says Shemilt. &quot;We are also sure that people are researching online and then
buying offline. Google Books provides reassurance to consumers that Cambridge
University Press content is relevant to their needs. It’s the publishing equivalent of being
able to walk around a car, look under the bonnet and kick the tyres before making the
decision to purchase.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">&quot;The fact that Book Search provides a link through to the Cambridge website and to a
selection of online retailers also provides an immediate call to action, making it simple to
buy,&quot; Shemilt adds. &quot;And although there are other variables in play, over 500,000 book
views per month is clearly having a positive impact.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Book Search is also making an impact on Cambridge’s digital ‘ultra short run’ printing
programme which is enabling the Press to keep more of its books available for longer
and bring some out-of-print books back from the dead. &quot;In order to fulfil our mission
to advance learning, knowledge and research, we intend, if feasible, to keep books in
print after sales have slowed down, and enabling discovery of these books is essential to
make this viable.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Google Books is a key component of the Cambridge University Press marketing
strategy. &quot;Direct marketing is the most important activity that we are involved in and
we are embracing the potential of Search and the Web to reach our niche audiences
effectively. The marketer’s role is changing in the digital age and it is essential that
Cambridge University Press is just as innovative and forward thinking as it has been
throughout its long history.&quot;
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><b>About Google Books</b> </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Google Books enables publishers to promote their books on Google. Google scans the full text of participating publishers' titles so that Google users can see books that match the topics they are searching on. When users click on a book search result, they're taken to a Google-hosted web page displaying a scanned image of the relevant page from the book. Each page also contains multiple &quot;Buy this Book&quot; links, which enable users to purchase the book from online retailers. Users may also see contextually targeted Google AdWords ads on these pages. Publishers will receive a share of the revenue generated from ads appearing on their content. </font></p></td>
