CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM OR TO DOWNLOAD OR USE THE UPLOADER. THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU (AS DEFINED
BELOW) AND GOOGLE INC. AND ITS AFFILIATES (“<strong>GOOGLE</strong>” OR “<strong>WE</strong>” OR “<strong>US</strong>”) IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY GOOGLE AT ANY TIME IN ITS SOLE AND
ABSOLUTE DISCRETION. BY CLICKING ON THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON BELOW OR BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT YOU (I) ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT EITHER FOR YOURSELF OR ON
BEHALF OF YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, (II) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND (III) HAVE ENTERED INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN
YOU AND GOOGLE INC. IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOUR EMPLOYER OR ANOTHER ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE FULL
LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND YOUR EMPLOYER OR SUCH ENTITY TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. </p>
<br><br>
<p><strong>Introduction.</strong> By entering into this Agreement, You are requesting to participate in the Program where Google provides hosting services at the
direction of content providers who seek to make their content available to end users, subject to the terms of this Agreement. “You” means you or, if you
are entering into this Agreement on behalf of your employer or another entity, then “You” means that employer or entity and affiliates. We may revise
the terms of this Agreement by providing the new terms and conditions for You to accept or reject when You next log in to the Program and by sending
notice to You at your email address of record. You must accept or reject the new terms and conditions within five (5) days from the date the notice was
sent to You, by logging into the Program at https://upload.video.google.com/ or as otherwise designated in writing by Google, and accepting or rejecting
the new terms. If You do not accept or reject the new terms within the five (5) day period, You will be deemed to have accepted and be bound by the new
terms. If You do not wish to be bound by the new terms, you must terminate this Agreement but You will no longer be able to participate in the Program.
</p>
<br>
<p><strong>1. Program Participation.</strong> Participation in the Program is subject to Google’s prior approval and Your continued compliance with the terms of
this Agreement. We reserve the right to refuse participation to any applicant or participant at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, and to
withdraw content, suspend, restrict and/or terminate the services provided under this Agreement and Your participation in the Program, immediately
without notice to You and without liability to Google, for any reason, including repeat violations of our copyright policy or other Program policies.

https://upload.video.google.com/. Multiple accounts held by the same individual or entity are subject to immediate termination unless expressly
authorized in writing by Google (including by electronic mail). You are solely responsible for keeping your email address and other contact information
updated. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>2. Your Content.</strong> After entering into this Agreement, You may designate content for hosting and display to end users (i) by uploading such
content directly to Us, by sending copies of Your content to Google at the address located at www.google.com/corporate/address.html, Attention: Google

available to Us; and (ii) by providing additional information about Your content in the form provided online when You upload Your content and/or by
submitting a completed metadata form as provided by Google to You (each, a “<strong>Metadata Form</strong>”) to Google at video-partner@google.com. All content

distribute the Authorized Content, in whole or in part, in the territory(ies) designated in the Metadata Form, in connection with Google products and
services now existing or hereafter developed, including without limitation for syndication on third party sites; and in connection with each of the
uses, if any, of the Authorized Content authorized in the video information page (the “Video Information Page”) which will be made available to You no
sooner than at the time Google enables any of the features designated on the Video Information Page This license gives Google the right to display
Your Authorized Content via streaming and/or downloading technologies, and to display limited excerpts of Your Authorized Content for no fee to the end
user. Google may in its sole discretion display a link or links to the website You designate (subject to Google’s approval) in the Metadata Form in
connection with any display of Your Authorized Content, and to display links to third party commercial retailer web sites where purchases of the
Authorized Content may be available, to the extent such third party commercial retailer web site serves as a distributor of the Authorized Content. You
expressly agree that any and all links provided by You shall function properly and effectively to allow end users to transfer immediately to the intended
and indicated site(s), and that You are solely responsible for maintaining and updating as necessary any such links. Failure to do so may result in
immediate termination without notice to You. Unless You specify otherwise in the Video Information Page, Google reserves the right to display
advertisements in connection with any display of Your Authorized Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Google is not required to host, index, or
display any Authorized Content uploaded or otherwise provided to Google, and may remove or refuse to host, index or display any Authorized Content.

advertising or promotional purposes, including without limitation the right to publicly display, perform, reproduce and distribute such excerpts and
Brand Features on the Internet and in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists, financial reports and Web site listings of customers. If this
Agreement is terminated, Google may continue to use such excerpts and Brand Features in printed (versus “online”) materials that are in existence as of
the date of termination until such materials are depleted or are redesigned, whichever comes first.</p>

regulation. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>10. Your Obligation to Indemnify.</strong> You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Google and its respective directors, officers, employees, and
applicable third parties (e.g. relevant advertisers, syndication partners, licensors, licensees, consultants and contractors) (collectively “Indemnified
Person(s)”) harmless from and against any and all third party claims, liability, loss and expense (including reasonable legal fees, damage awards, and
settlement amounts) brought against any Indemnified Person(s) arising out of, or related to or which may arise from Your Authorized Content, Your Brand
Features, Google’s authorized use of any of the foregoing, Your use of the Program and the Uploader, and/or Your breach of this Agreement. The
Indemnified Persons may in their sole discretion control the defense, at Your expense, of any claim indemnified herein. In the event that the
Indemnified Parties determine not to control the defense of any claim hereunder, any Indemnified Person may join in defense with counsel of its choice at
its own expense. You will not settle or resolve any such claim in a manner that imposes any liability or obligation on Google or affects Google’s rights
in connection therewith without the advance written approval of Google, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.	</p>
<br>
<p><strong>11. Termination; Withdrawal of Content.</strong> Either party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party if the
other party files a petition for bankruptcy, becomes insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or a receiver is appointed for
the other party or its business. You may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days prior written notice. You may withdraw Your
Authorized Content from public display in the Program by providing Google with a written request as set forth in the FAQ. Google will use commercially
reasonable efforts to remove Your Authorized Content from public display within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice of termination or withdrawal.
Google may at any time in its sole discretion and without liability to Google terminate the Program or any product, service or feature offered in the
Program, terminate this Agreement, or withdraw any Authorized Content in the Program. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>12.	Privacy and Information Rights.</strong> You agree that We may use information that You provide to Us when You register for the Program in
accordance with the privacy policy located at http://www.google.com/privacy.html. In addition, You agree that Google may transfer and disclose this
information, including personally identifiable information, to third parties for the purpose of approving and enabling your participation in the Program,
including to third parties that reside in jurisdictions with less restrictive data laws than Your own. Google may provide any of the above information in
response to valid legal processes, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against
legal claims. Google disclaims all responsibility, and will not be liable to You, however, for any disclosure of that information by any such third
party. </p>
<br>
<p><strong>13. General.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>a. Notices.</strong> Unless provided for to the contrary in this Agreement, any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
required or permitted to be made under this Agreement shall be sent (a) if to You at the electronic mail address You provide in registering for the
Program and (b) if to Google to such address as provided at www.google.com/corporate/address.html or as otherwise provided in writing for such notice
purposes. A second copy of every notice to Google shall be sent to the same address, “Attn: Legal Dept.” Notice shall be deemed received (i) upon
receipt when delivered personally, (ii) upon written verification of receipt from overnight courier, (iii) upon verification of receipt of registered or
certified mail (iv) upon verification of receipt via facsimile, provided that such notice is also sent simultaneously via first class mail, or (v) by
electronic mail when sent by Google only. Contact information shall be updated as necessary to ensure that each party has current information regarding
all such contacts.</p>
<p> <strong>b. Miscellaneous.</strong> You may not resell, assign or transfer any of Your rights hereunder. Any such attempt shall be null and void.
The relationship between Google and You is not one of a legal partnership relationship, but is one of independent contractors. The words “You” or “Your”
shall also mean heirs, executors, administrators, successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns. This Agreement does not affect any right that
either party would have had, or shall have, independent of the Agreement including rights relating to Authorized Content under applicable law, including
but not limited to copyright law. Neither party shall be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition
beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor
conditions, power failures, and Internet or other network disturbances. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall
otherwise remain in full force and effect and remain enforceable between the parties. The failure of either party to act in the event of a breach of
this Agreement by the other shall not be deemed a waiver of such breach or a waiver of future breaches. The section titles used in this Agreement are
purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect. Except as to any prior version of this Content Hosting Service Agreement
between you and Google that sets forth the license to and use by Google of your Authorized Content, (i) nothing in this Agreement is intended to be, or
will be construed as, altering, revising, modifying or otherwise amending any other content hosting services agreement; and (ii) in the event of a
conflict between this Agreement and any other content hosting service agreement that You enter into with Google with respect to Your Authorized Content,
