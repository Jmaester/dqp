<h4 id="top">Product descriptions</h4>

<p>Google's product development reflects our focus on rapid and continuous innovation. We frequently release new technologies that we aim to improve with each iteration. Often, we make products available early in their development stages by posting them on Google Labs, at test locations online, or directly on Google.com. If our users find a product useful, we promote it to "beta" status for additional testing. These test periods often last a year or more. Once we are satisfied that a product is of high quality and utility, we remove the beta label. Here is a current summary of Google products; you may also want to visit <a href="../options/index.html">the "More" list</a>.</p>

<strong><a name="alerts"></a><a href="/alerts">Alerts</a></strong> 
<p>Get email automatically when there are new Google results for your search terms. We currently offer three types of alerts: News, Web, and News &amp; Web.</p>
<ul>
  <li>News Alert: email notification about new articles that appear in the top 10 results of your Google News search.</li>
   <li>Web Alert: email notification for new web pages that appear in the top 20 results for your Google web search.</li>
   <li>News &amp; Web Alert: email notification when new articles related to your search term make it into the top 10 results for a Google News search, or the top 20 results for a Google web search.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Alerts to monitor a developing news story, keep current on an industry or a competitor, track medical advances, sports teams, or celebrities. The frequency you select (daily, weekly, or as it happens) for your Alerts determines how often Google checks for new results, not necessarily how often you'll receive alerts. If you select "once a day," we'll check for new results once a day, which means you'll get a maximum of one email per day. If you choose the "as it happens," we'll check for new results continuously and send you an alert whenever we find a new result.</p>

<strong><a name="blog"></a><a href="/blogsearch">Blog Search</a></strong> 
<p>Google Blog Search is the easiest way to search for blog content on the web. Using the same technology that powers Google's web search, Google Blog Search provides fresh, relevant search results from millions of feed-enabled blogs. Users can search for blog posts, blog names, authors, or a specific date range. Google Blog Search also features Google's SafeSearch technology, giving users control over the content of their search results.</p>

<strong><a name="book"></a><a href="http://books.google.com/">Book Search</a></strong> 
<p>Google Book Search is an index of book content that makes it easy to find books that interest you. Like a card catalog, it helps you learn where to get the full book from a bookstore or a library. Use the Google Book Search homepage to get only book results, or Google.com to see book results as part of your regular search results. Google Book Search makes the full text of millions of books (including out of print and public domain books) instantly searchable, and makes those books discoverable. For authors and publishers, it means that millions of books are instantly discoverable — and able to be purchased. Google Book Search acts as a free marketing program that protects copyright while dramatically expanding the potential audience for, in theory, every book in the world. </p>

<strong><a name="catalogs"></a><a href="http://catalogs.google.com/">Catalogs</a></strong>
<p>Access to the full content of more than 6,600 mail order catalogs, many of which were previously unavailable online.</p>

<strong><a name="cse"></a><a href="/coop/cse/">Custom Search Engine</a></strong>
<p>Built with Google's core search technology, the Custom Search Engine prioritizes or restricts search results based on websites and pages that users specify, and can be tailored to reflect a point of view or area of expertise. Creators of a Custom Search Engine can make it look and feel like their website or blog; generate revenue from their Custom Search Engine by participating in the Google AdSense program; and collaborate with others to include more sites in their search index.</p>

<strong><a name="desktop"></a><a href="http://desktop.google.com/">Desktop</a></strong>
<p>This is a free client application that provides full text search over email, files, music, photos, chats, web pages that you've viewed, and more. By making your computers searchable, Google Desktop puts your information easily within your reach and frees you from having to manually organize your files. Google Desktop for Windows also helps you gather new information from the web with gadgets and sidebar. (<a href="/webmasters/gadgets/">Google Gadgets</a> are visually appealing mini-applications that can display anything from your new email to the local weather forecast to personalized news.)</p>

<strong><a name="directory"></a><a href="/dirhp">Directory</a></strong>
<p>Google Web Directory enables people to browse and search through websites that have been organized into categories. Our directory combines Google search technology with the categorization developed by the Open Directory Project; it is available in 75 languages.</p>

<strong><a name="finance"></a><a href="http://finance.google.com">Finance</a></strong>
<p>Google Finance offers quick and easy access to business and financial information about mutual funds and public and private companies. Features include interactive charts with corresponding news stories; company search by name or ticker symbol; stories from Google News grouped by topic; blog posts from across the web via Google Blog Search; on-topic discussion groups; and easy-to-use portfolios to track your financial information.</p>

<strong><a name="gears"></a><a href="http://gears.google.com">Gears</a></strong>
<p>An open source browser extension that enables developers to build web applications that run offline. With its local database, local server and multi-threading features, it can also improve application performance, especially with slow or unreliable Internet connections. Google Gears works across all major browsers and platforms and is currently available for beta testing and developer feedback.</p>

<strong><a name="images"></a><a href="http://images.google.com">Images</a></strong>
<p>Our searchable index of billions of images found across the web. Includes advanced features such as search by image size, format and coloration and restricting searches to specific web sites or domains.</p>

<strong><a name="lang_tools"></a><a href="/language_tools">Google Language Tools</a></strong>
<p>Search for web content in any of more than 40 languages, or by country domain (157 at last count). You can also <a href="/translate_t">translate</a> text to and from several languages or translate a web page by submitting a URL. We also provide links to Google.com in more than 100 languages and links to all of the current country domains we offer.</p>

<strong><a name="personalized"></a><a href="/psearch">Personalized Search</a></strong>
<p>Personalized Search ranks Google search results based on what's most relevant to an individual user. The Web History feature of Personalized Search enables users to view and manage all of their web activity. Over time, this information personalizes future searches by bringing results closer to the top when it's clear they are the most relevant to a searcher.</p>
<p>Personalized Search Reviewer's Guide (<a href="guides/personalized_overview.pdf">PDF - 1MB</a>)</p>

<strong><a name="products"></a><a href="/products">Product Search</a></strong> 
<p>Our shopping search engine uses the power of Google search technology to help shoppers find the items they want, both online and in nearby stores. You can sort results by price or store location, see product and merchant reviews, specify a desired price range and view photos. Product Search accepts data feeds directly from merchants to ensure that product information is accurate and up to date. Because we do not charge merchants for inclusion in Product Search, shoppers can browse categories or conduct searches with confidence that the results we provide are relevant and unbiased. As with many Google products, Product Search displays relevant advertising separately from search results.</p>

<strong><a name="scholar"></a><a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Scholar</a></strong>
<p>Find scholarly literature (peer-reviewed papers, theses, preprints, abstracts and technical reports) from a wide variety of academic publishers, professional societies, preprint repositories and universities and across the web. As with Google Web Search, Google Scholar presents search results in order of relevance to your query, so the most useful references should appear at the top of the page. This relevance ranking takes into account the full text of each article as well as the article's author, the publication in which the article appeared and how often it has been cited in scholarly literature. Google Scholar also automatically analyzes and extracts citations and presents them as separate results, even if the documents they refer to are not online, so search results may include citations of older works and seminal articles that appear only in books or other offline publications. </p>

<strong><a name="sketchup"></a><a href="http://sketchup.google.com">SketchUp</a></strong>
<p>Combining the elegance and spontaneity of pencil sketching with the speed and flexibility of today's digital media, Google SketchUp provides a powerful yet easy-to-learn tool for creating and modifying 3D models.  By inserting their models into Google Earth, design professionals and hobbyists alike can share their creations with the world.</p>

<strong><a name="toolbar"></a><a href="/tools/firefox/toolbar/FT3/intl/en/index.html">Toolbar</a></strong> 
<p>The Google Toolbar is a free download that adds a Google search box to your web browser (Firefox or Internet Explorer). The Toolbar also includes innovative features that make browsing more efficient, such as a web form filler, spellchecker, word translator, and pop-up blocker (for IE).</p>
<p>With the Google Toolbar, you can make your Toolbar as unique as you are. You can add buttons and bookmarks, get instant search suggestions, and share web pages with friends via email, blog, or SMS.</p>

<strong><a name="accelerator"></a><a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/">Web Accelerator</a></strong>
<p>Google Web Accelerator uses the power of Google's global computer network to make web pages load faster.</p>

<strong><a name="websearch"></a><a href="/">Google Web Search</a></strong>
<p> In addition to providing easy access to billions of web pages, we have integrated special features into Google web search to help people find exactly what they are looking for on the web. The Google search experience also includes these features (you’ll find the full list <a href="/intl/en/help/features.html">here</a>).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Advanced search functionality</b> - construct more complex queries, for example by using Boolean logic or restricting results to languages, countries or web sites.</li>
  <li><b>Spell checker</b> - suggests alternate search terms when a search appears to contain misspellings or typing errors.</li>
    <li><b>Web page translation</b> - automatically translates web pages published in French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish into English, or vice versa.</li>
    <li><b>Stock quotes</b> - provides links to stock and mutual fund information.</li>
    <li><b>Street maps</b> - provides links to street maps and directions.</li>
    <li><b>Calculator</b> - solves math problems involving basic arithmetic, complicated math or physical constants and converts between units of measure.</li>
    <li><b>Definitions</b> - provides definitions for words or phrases based on content we have indexed.</li> 
    <li><b>Phone book</b> - provides U.S. street addresses and phone numbers for U.S. businesses and residences.</li>
    <li><b>Search by number</b> - conduct quick searches by entering FedEx, UPS and USPS package tracking numbers, vehicle ID numbers, product codes, telephone area codes, patent numbers, FAA airplane registration numbers and FCC equipment ID numbers. 
    <li><b>Travel information</b> - check the status of U.S. airline flights and see delays and weather conditions at U.S. airports.</li>
    <li><b>Cached links</b> - snapshots of web pages taken when the pages were indexed, enabling you to view pages that are no longer available.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also choose to receive search results in only your native language as Google.com now supports localized searches in more than 40 languages.</p>


<h2 class="sectionHead"><a name="ads">Ads</a><span class="top"><a href="#top">Return to top</a></span></h2>

<strong><a name="adsense"></a><a href="http://adsense.google.com">AdSense</a></strong>
<p>The Google AdSense program enables websites in the Google Network of content sites to automatically serve text and image ads that are precisely targeted to site content &#150; so well-matched, in fact, that readers actually find them useful. Targeting can be based on search results or on web content. We share most of the revenue generated from these ads with our partner publishers.</p>

<p>Most of the websites that make up the Google Network sign up online, and we also sell directly to sites with significant traffic, under agreements that vary in duration. For our network members, we offer: </p>

<ul>
<li><b>AdSense for search</b>. This enables websites of any size to generate additional revenue by serving relevant AdWords ads targeted to search results. Because we also offer to license our web search technology along with Google AdSense for search, companies without their own search service can offer Google Web Search to improve their sites' usefulness while increasing their revenue.</li>

<li><b>AdSense for content</b>. This program enables website publishers to generate revenue from advertising by serving relevant AdWords ads targeted to web content. Our automated technology analyzes the meaning of web content and serves relevant advertising. AdSense for content can help websites offset publishing costs or even become a primary revenue stream. There is no charge for websites to participate in this program. Using our automated sign-up process, web sites can quickly display AdWords ads on their sites. We share the majority of the revenues generated from clickthroughs on these ads with Google Network members that display the ads. For websites with more than 20 million page views per month, we offer customized services.</li>
</ul>

<strong><a name="adwords"></a><a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/Login?sourceid=awo&subid=na-en-et-presscenter_prodescript&medium=link">AdWords</a></strong>
<p>Google AdWords is our global advertising program that enables advertisers to reach the people who are interested in their products or services. Advertisers use our automated tools, often with little or no assistance from us, to create ads, place bids to serve their ads, select the types of sites where they'd like their ads to appear, and set daily spending budgets. AdWords features an automated, low-cost online signup process that enables advertisers to implement campaigns that can go live in 15 minutes or less.</p>

<p>AdWords ranks ads for display in one of two ways: either by CPM (cost per thousand) or a by combination of the maximum cost per click (CPC), which is set by the advertiser, together with clickthrough rates and other factors used to determine the relevance of the ads. This process favors the ads that are most relevant to users, improving the experience for both the person looking for information and the advertiser looking for interested customers. AdWords has many features that make it easy to set up and manage ad campaigns for maximum efficiency and effectiveness:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Campaign management</b>. Advertisers can target multiple ads to a given keyword or content site and easily track the performance of individual ads to see which ones are the most effective. The campaign management tools built into AdWords enable advertisers to quickly shift their budgets to ads that deliver the best results.</li>
<li><b>Geographic and language targeting</b>. Advertisers can target their ads by country, region or by a radius around an area they choose. Ads can also be targeted to the language of the prospective customer.</li>
<li><b>Keyword targeting</b>. Advertisers can deliver targeted ads based on specific search terms (keywords) entered by users or found in the content on a web page. We also offer tools to help advertisers consider synonyms and useful phrases to use as keywords or ad text. By choosing relevant keywords advertisers can improve ad clickthrough rates and the likelihood that a user will become a customer.</li>
<li><b>Site targeting</b>. Advertisers can specify which content sites they would like their ads to run on. As with keyword targeting, we offer tools that enable advertisers to target their ads to the right audience based on information related to a specific topic or theme.</li>
<li><b>Traffic Estimator</b>. This tool estimates the number of searches and potential costs related to advertising on a particular keyword or set of keywords. And in turn these estimates can help advertisers optimize their keyword-targeted campaigns.</li>
<li><b>Budgeted delivery</b>. Advertisers can set daily budgets for their campaigns and control the timing for delivery of their ads.</li>
<li><b>Performance reports</b>. We provide timely and continuous reporting on the effectiveness of each ad campaign</li>
<li><b>Multiple payment options</b>. We accept credit and debit cards and, for selected advertisers, we offer several options for credit terms and monthly invoicing. Advertisers can make payments in 48 currencies.</li>
<li><b>AdWords Discounter</b>. This feature gives advertisers the freedom to increase their maximum bids (CPM or CPC) because it automatically adjusts pricing so that they never pay more than one cent over the next highest bid.</li>
<li><b>Conversion tracking</b>.
