<div>"The
result [of the Google Books settlement] will be ubiquitous online
access to a collection unparalleled in size and scope, preservation of
the scholarly and cultural record embodied in the collections of great
research libraries, new lines of research, and greatly expanded access
to the world's printed work for persons with print disabilities."<br /><br />

Google settlement provides a mechanism whereby the print works of the
20th century will be searchable, findable, readable and generally
usable online, with large parts of the text readable online for free.
All of this is of tremendous public and scholarly value, and no one
other than Google has shown any willingness to make the investment
necessary to get the job done."</div><br /></div>
