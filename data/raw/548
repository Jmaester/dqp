<p><b class="si">History of Google Books</b></p>
<p><font size="-1">In the beginning, there was Google Books. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Well, not exactly. But one can  certainly argue that the project is as old as Google itself. In 1996,  Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were graduate computer  science students working on a research project supported by the  Stanford Digital Library Technologies Project. Their goal was to make  digital libraries work, and their big idea was as follows: in a future  world in which vast collections of books are digitized, people would  use a "web crawler" to index the books' content and analyze the  connections between them, determining any given book's relevance and  usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other  books. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">The crawler they wound up building was  called BackRub, and it was this modern twist on traditional citation  analysis that inspired Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">PageRank</a> algorithms – the core search technology that makes Google, well, Google. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Even then, Larry and Sergey envisioned  people everywhere being able to search through all of the world's books  to find the ones they're looking for. What they couldn't have imagined  was that one day they would launch a project to help make it happen.  Herewith, a brief tour through some of the major milestones so far: </font></p>
<h4> [2002] </h4>
<p> <font size="-1">A small group of Googlers officially  launches the secret "books" project. They begin talking to experts  about the challenges ahead, starting with a simple but crucial  question: how long would it take to digitally scan every book in the  world? It turns out, oddly enough, that no one knows. In typical Google  fashion, Larry Page decides to experiment on his own. In the office one  day, he and Marissa Mayer, one of our first product managers, use a  metronome to keep rhythm as they methodically turn the pages of a  300-page volume. It takes a full 40 minutes to reach the end. </font></p>
<p><font size="-1">Inspired by the extraordinary digitization projects underway all around the world – the Library of Congress's <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/index.html">American Memory</a> project, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>, the <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/millionbooks">Million Book Project</a> and the <a href="http://www.ul.cs.cmu.edu/html/">Universal Library</a>, to name only a few – the team embarks on a series of site visits to learn about how they work. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> As part of this fact-finding mission,  Larry Page reaches out to the University of Michigan, his alma mater  and a pioneer in library digitization efforts including <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> and <a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/m/moagrp/">Making of America</a>. When he learns that the current estimate for scanning the university library's seven million volumes is 1,000 years, he <a href="http://www.umich.edu/pres/speeches/060206google.html">tells</a> university president Mary Sue Coleman he believes Google can help make it happen in six. </font></p>
<h4> [2003] </h4>
<p> <font size="-1">A team member travels to a charity book  fair in Phoenix, Arizona, to acquire books for testing non-destructive  scanning techniques. After countless rounds of experimentation, the  team develops a scanning method that's much gentler than current common  high-speed processes. This makes the team happy – and the books  themselves even happier. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> At the same time, the team's software  engineers make progress toward resolving the tricky technical issues  they encounter processing information from books that contain odd type  sizes, unusual fonts or other unexpected peculiarities – in 430  different languages. </font></p>
<h4> [2004] </h4>
<p> <font size="-1">Established in 1602 by Sir Thomas  Bodley, the mission of the Bodleian library at Oxford University has  always been to serve not just the university community but the entire  world. The team visits the renowned library and is overwhelmed by the  warm reception they receive. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> During a tour of the stacks, the  librarians bring out centuries-old "uncut" books that have only rarely  seen the light of day. For the first time since Shakespeare was a  working playwright, the dream of exponentially expanding the small  circle of literary scholars with access to these books seems within  reach. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> The visit is inspiring, and follow-up meetings and discussions lead to a <a href="http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/news/news58.htm">formal partnership</a> to digitize the library's incomparable collection of more than one million 19th-century public domain books within three years. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Meanwhile, a series of exploratory  talks with some of the world's biggest publishers begins to bear fruit.  In October, Larry and Sergey announce "Google Print" at the <a href="http://www.frankfurt-book-fair.com/en/portal.php">Frankfurt Book Fair</a> in Germany. The first publishers to join the program: Blackwell,  Cambridge University Press, the University of Chicago Press, Houghton  Mifflin, Hyperion, McGraw-Hill, Oxford University Press, Pearson,  Penguin, Perseus, Princeton University Press, Springer, Taylor &amp;  Francis, Thomson Delmar and Warner Books. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> In December, we <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/print_library.html">announce</a> the beginning of the "Google Print" <a href="http://print.google.com/googleprint/library.html">Library Project</a>,  made possible by partnerships with Harvard, the University of Michigan,  the New York Public Library, Oxford and Stanford. The combined  collections at these extraordinary libraries are estimated to exceed 15  million volumes. </font></p>
<h4> [2005] </h4>
<p> <font size="-1">One year after Google Print's debut,  the team returns to the Frankfurt Book Fair to reveal that "Google  Print" is now accepting partners in eight European countries: Austria,  Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and  Switzerland. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> In keeping with our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, we <a href="http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2005/05-250.html">donate</a> $3 million to the Library of Congress to help build the World Digital  Library, which will provide online access to a collection of rare and  unique items from all around the world. We also extend our pilot  scanning program with the Library, which includes digitizing works of  historical value from the Library of Congress Law Library. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/11/judging-book-search-by-its-cover.html">renames</a> "Google Print" Google Books, which more accurately reflects how  people use it. The team also responds to the controversy over the  Library Project by engaging in <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/point-of-google-print.html">public debate</a> about its underlying principles. </font></p>
<h4> [2006] </h4>
<p> <font size="-1">In a <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=mary+sue+coleman">moving speech</a> at the Association of American Publishers (AAP), University of Michigan  president Mary Sue Coleman explains why the university has chosen to  partner with us on the Library Project, underscoring the importance of  digitizing books in the face of natural disasters like Hurricane  Katrina and adding, "We believed in this forever."<br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> In March we attend the <a href="http://www.lbf-virtual.com/">London Book Fair</a>, where some of our publisher partners share their experiences so far. <br />
</font></p>
<p><font size="-1"> Shortly afterward, we invite our  partners to tell us whether they wish to sell readers full access to  books online – right in their browsers. This is the first of many new  options we're developing in close collaboration with publishers to help  them experiment with innovative ways to sell books online. </font></p>
<font size="-1">Over the summer, we help Shakespeare in the Park kick off its 50th year with free performances in Central Park by creating <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/no-holds-bard.html">a place to find and search the Bard's complete plays online</a>. While in NYC, we also attend Book Expo America, and give publishers' and authors' in the US <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2976180681496142221">a taste of what users will see</a> when they join the Books Partner Program.<strong><br />
<br />
</strong>We launch a series of product  enhancements to make Book Search more useful and easier to use. First,  we expand access to the public domain works we've scanned by adding a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/download-classics.html">download a PDF</a> button to all out-of-copyright books. A few months later, we release a <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2006/11/what-weve-been-working-on.html">new browsing interface</a> that makes it easier to browse and navigate Book Search. The new interface is also accompanied by new <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN048625514X&amp;id=yGVZNPWkqJUC">About this Book</a> pages which use Google algorithms to populate pages with rich related  content on a book -- initially, related books, selected pages and  references from scholarly works.  <br />
<br />
In the fall, four new libraries join  the Library Project: the University of California, University  Complutense of Madrid, the University of Wisconsin- Madison and the  University of Virginia.</font><br />
<br />
<strong>[2007]<br />
</strong><br />
<font size="-1">Using the new UI as a launching point, we experiment with new ways for people to interact with books.<br />
<br />
</font>
<ul>
<li> <font size="-1"><a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/01/books-mapped.html">Places in this Book</a>: A  mashup with Maps lets people browse books by locations mentioned in the text (later, we release an experimental <a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/08/book-lovers-view-of-world.html">KML layer</a> for Google Earth that does the reverse -- the user picks a location, and we map books to it).<br />
</font></li>
<li> <font size="-1"><a href="/books?id=-6qA0bGjja8C&amp;qtid=767e78db">Popular Passages</a>: We create a new way to navigate between books, tracking the use of a single passage through a collection of books. </font></li>
<li> <font size="-1"><a href="http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2007/09/my-own-library-on-book-search.html">My Library</a>:  We help people harness the power of Google search within their own  personal book collections. Users begin to curate and share their <a href="mylibrary/">personal libraries</a>, reviews and ratings with others. </font></li>
<li> <font size="-1"><a href="/">New homepage</a> (initially US only): We give people more jumping off points for exploring the books in our index.<br />
</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="-1"><br />
Marissa Mayer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrOtmjtX1Y">introduces Universal Search in the US</a>, and Book Search becomes a more integrated part of the Google search experience. <br />
<br />
In May, the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne, and <a href="http://lib1.ugent.be/cmsites/default.aspx?ref=ABAF&amp;lang=NL_BO">Ghent University Library</a> join the Book Search program, adding a substantial amount of books in  French, German, Flemish, Latin and other languages, and bringing the  total number of European libraries partners to six.<br />
<br />
In July, we add a "View plain text" link to all out-of-copyright books. T.V. Raman <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/ever-more-books-to-read.html">explains how this opens the book</a>  to adaptive technologies such as screen readers  and Braille display, allowing visually impaired users to read these  books just as easily as users with sight.<br />
<br />
By December, the Book Search interface is available in over 35 languages, from <a href="http://books.google.co.jp/">Japanese</a> to <a href="http://books.google.ch/">Czech</a> to <a href="http://books.google.fi/">Finnish</a>.  Over 10,000 publishers and authors from <a href="http://books.google.com/googlebooks/success.html">100+ countries are participating</a> in the Book Search Partner Program.  The Library Project expands to 28  partners, including seven international library partners: Oxford  University (UK), University of Complutense of Madrid (Spain), the  National Library of Catalonia (Spain), University Library of Lausanne  (Switzerland), Ghent University (Belgium) and Keio University (Japan).<br />
<br />
As we look to the year ahead, we  continue to develop our technology and expand our partnerships with  publishers and libraries all around the world. Stay tuned...</font></td>
