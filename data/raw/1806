<td valign="top"><p><font size="-1">The project with Google is
                   core to our mission as a great public university to advance
                   knowledge &mdash; on campus and beyond. By joining this partnership
                   that makes our library holdings searchable through Google,
                   UM serves as an agent in an initiative that radically increases
                   the availability of information to the public. The University
                   of Michigan embraces this project as a means to make information
                   available as broadly and conveniently as possible. Moreover,
                   the UM Library embarked on this ground-breaking partnership
                   for a number of very compelling reasons: </font></p>
<ul>
<li><font size="-1"> We believe that, beyond providing basic
                         access to library collections, this activity is critically
                         transformative, enabling the University Library to build
                         on and reconceive vital library services for the new
                         millennium. </font></li>
<li><font size="-1"> This work will create new ways for users
                         to search and access library content, opening up our
                         collections to our own users and to users throughout
                         the world. </font></li>
<li><font size="-1"> Although we have engaged in large-scale,
                         preservation-based conversion of materials in the Library's
                         collection for several years, and have been a leader
                         in digital preservation efforts among research libraries,
                         we know that only through partnerships of this sort can
                         conversion of this scale be achieved.&nbsp;Our program
                         is strong, and we have been able to digitize approximately
                         5,000 volumes/year; nevertheless, at this rate, it would
                         take us more than a thousand years to digitize our entire
                         collection.&quot; </font></li>

                               Historical Society Library comprise one of the largest collections of documents and historical materials in the United States.
                               Through this landmark partnership with Google, Wisconsin is taking a leading role in preserving public domain works for
                               future generations and making the Library's resources widely available for education and research. This effort truly exemplifies
                               the vision of The Wisconsin Idea -- the notion that the boundaries of the university are limitless. The Wisconsin libraries
                               have been following in this tradition. The Google digitization efforts will enable the libraries to expand access to public
                               domain materials that have heretofore only been accessible in the libraries. Much of this material is rare and one-of-a-kind,
