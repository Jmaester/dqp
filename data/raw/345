	<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
				<div>
  <div class="group">
      <div class="post-body">
    	<p>The following Terms of Use outline your obligations when using the Digg website. You can also review our Privacy Policy, which outlines our obligations and practices towards handling any personal information that you may provide to us.</p>

	<h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>

	<p>The web pages available at <a href="http://digg.com">digg.com</a>, and all linked pages (&#8220;Site&#8221;), are owned and operated by Digg, Inc. (&#8220;Digg&#8221;), a Delaware corporation, and is accessed by you under the Terms of Use described below (&#8220;Terms of Use&#8221;).</p>

	<p>Please read these terms of use carefully before using Digg or its services. By accessing Digg or using any part of the Site you agree to become bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions, then you may not access Digg, or use the content or any services offered. Digg’s acceptance is expressly conditioned upon your assent to all these terms and conditions, to the exclusion of all other terms; if these terms and conditions are considered an offer by Digg, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.</p>

	<h3>2. Modifications of the Terms of Use</h3>

	<p>We may revise these terms from time to time, and the most current version will be at <a href="http://about.digg.com/terms-use" title="http://about.digg.com/terms-use">http://about.digg.com/terms-use</a>. If the revision, at our sole discretion, is considered a material change we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Site. You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications. Use of the Services after such notification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms of Use as modified.</p>

	<h3>3. Description of the Service</h3>

	<p>Subject to full compliance with the Terms of Use, Digg may offer to provide certain services and content, as described more fully on the Site, (&#8220;Services&#8221;). Digg may change, suspend or discontinue the Services including any content (including, but not limited to text, user comments, messages, data, information, graphics, news articles, photographs, images, illustrations, software, audio clips, and video clips) for any reason, at any time, including the availability of any feature or content. Digg may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.</p>

	<h3>4. Your Registration Obligations</h3>

	<p>You may not (i) select or use as a Digg User ID a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a Digg User ID a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a Digg User ID a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. We reserve the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a Digg User ID at our discretion; if you select a User ID for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it infringes upon another’s rights or marks. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Digg password.</p>

	<p>Services are available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old, whether acting on their own behalf or as an authorized employee or representative of a corporation or other business entity. If you are under 13 years old, do not attempt to register or use the Services.</p>

	<p>Mass or serial account creation: while there are limited, legitimate reasons for creating multiple accounts, creating serial or overlapping accounts may result in account termination. Please contact us if you have questions about managing multiple accounts.</p>

	<h3>5. User Conduct</h3>

	<p>As a condition of use, you promise not to use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Use, or any other purpose not reasonably intended by Digg. We respect other people’s rights and we expect you to do the same.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>to abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate other Digg users;</li>
		<li>to post or transmit any content that is infringing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, offensive, profane, or otherwise violates any law or right of any third party, or content that contains homophobia, ethnic slurs or religious intolerance;</li>
		<li>for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. If you are an international user, you agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content;</li>
		<li>to post or transmit any communication or solicitation designed or intended to obtain password, account, or private information from any Digg user;</li>
		<li>to create or submit unwanted email (&#8220;Spam&#8221;) to any other Digg users or any <span class="caps">URL</span>;</li>
		<li>to violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws);</li>
		<li>to submit stories or comments linking to multi-level marketing schemes</li>
		<li>with the exception of accessing <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds, you will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Site for any purpose without our express written permission. Additionally, you agree that you will not: (i) take any action that imposes, or may impose in our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Site or any activities conducted on the Site; or (iii) bypass any measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site;</li>
		<li>with the intention of artificially inflating or altering the &#8216;digg count&#8217;, comments, or any other Digg service, including by way of creating separate user accounts for the purpose of artificially altering Digg&#8217;s services; giving or receiving money or other remuneration in exchange for votes; or participating in any other organized effort that in any way artificially alters the results of Digg&#8217;s services;</li>
		<li>attempt to impersonate another user or person;</li>
		<li>sell or otherwise transfer your profile.  <br />
In addition, you agree that you will not use the Service (including, without limitation by “Digging” any content) on behalf of (or per the request or instruction of) any third party, or pay or otherwise attempt to influence any third to manipulate or otherwise affect the site in any manner (including, without limitation, by paying any other user to “Digg” any content).</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Digg may remove any content and Digg accounts at any time for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such content), or for no reason at all. To report Terms of Use abuse, please email: <a href="mailto:abuse@digg.com">abuse@digg.com</a></p>

Upon receipt of notices complying or substantially complying with the <span class="caps">DMCA</span>, Digg may act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and may act expeditiously to remove or disable access to any reference or link to material or activity that is claimed to be infringing. Digg will terminate access for subscribers and account holders who are repeat infringers.</p>

	<p>Notifying Digg of Copyright Infringement: To provide Digg notice of an infringement, you must provide a written communication to the attention of &#8220;<span class="caps">DMCA</span> Infringement Notification Dept.&#8221; care of <a href="mailto:support@digg.com">support@digg.com</a> that sets forth the information specified by the <span class="caps">DMCA</span> (<a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512" title="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512">http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512</a>).

	<h3>11. Links and Merchandise</h3>

	<p>The Services may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. Because Digg has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that Digg is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Digg shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such site or resource. </p>

	<p>Neither Digg nor its third party service providers make any warranties with respect to any of the merchandise, products, and/or services featured, mentioned, or sold by others on or through the Site. Transactions for any such item shall be between the user and the third party seller, without any involvement of Digg or its third party service providers. You agree that Diggand its third party service providers are not responsible, and shall have no liability to you, with respect to merchandise, products, and/or services featured, mentioned, or sold by others on or through the Site, including illegal, offensive or illicit items, or items that violate this Agreement.  </p>

	<h3>12. Limitation of Liability</h3>

	<p>In no event shall Digg or its suppliers be liable under contract, tort or strict liability, negligence or other legal theory (i) with respect to the Site, the Service or any content for any lost profits or special, indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever, substitute goods or services (however arising), or (ii) for any direct damages in excess of (in the aggregate) $100. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.  </p>

	<h3>13. Termination</h3>

	<p>Digg may terminate or suspend any and all Services and your Digg account immediately, without prior notice or liability, if Digg has a reasonable belief that you may have breached any of the terms or conditions of the Terms of Use. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your Digg account, you may simply discontinue using the Services. All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

	<h3>14. Miscellaneous</h3>

	<p>No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of the Terms of Use and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Digg in any respect whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Digg shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Digg&#8217;s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including &#8220;line-noise&#8221; interference). If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The Terms of Use is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Digg&#8217;s prior written consent. Digg may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms of Use and its rights and obligations without consent. The Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, as if made within California between two residents thereof, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of San Francisco County and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (but without limiting Digg&#8217;s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction), any disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall be referred to an arbitrator affiliated with <span class="caps">JAMS</span>, The Resolution Experts. The arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties. In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with <span class="caps">JAMS</span>, which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve the dispute. The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties. The arbitration proceeding shall be carried on and heard in San Francisco, California using the English language and pursuant to the rules of <span class="caps">JAMS</span>. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys&#8217; fees. Both parties agree that the Terms of Use is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of the Terms of Use, and that all modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein.</p>  </div>
